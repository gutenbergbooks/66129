</div>

<p class='c009'>The first edition was published in two 8vo volumes, the first volume in 1821
with the following title-page: ‘Table-Talk; or, Original Essays. By William
Hazlitt. London: John Warren, Old Bond-Street 1821’; the second volume
in 1822 with the following title-page: ‘Table-Talk; or, Original Essays. By
William Hazlitt. Vol. <span class='fss'>II.</span> London: Printed for Henry Colburn and Co. 1822.’
Both volumes were printed by Thomas Davison, Whitefriars. The first volume
contained the following Advertisement:  ‘It may be proper to observe, that the
Essays “On the Pleasure of Painting” and “On the Ignorance of the Learned,”
in this Volume, have already appeared in periodical publications.’ The second
volume contained a list of ‘errata.’ The second edition appeared in 1824 in two
8vo volumes. The title-page ran as follows: ‘Table-Talk, or Original Essays on
Men and Manners. Second Edition. London: Printed for Henry Colburn, New
Burlington Street. 1824.’ The volumes were printed by J. Nichols and Son,
25 Parliament Street. This edition, apparently a mere reprint of the first edition,
is here reprinted <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbatim</span></i> except that the mistakes referred to in the  ‘errata’ of the
first edition have been corrected. In 1825 two 8vo volumes appeared in Paris
(A. &amp; W. Galignani) entitled, ‘Table-Talk: or Original Essays, By William
Hazlitt.’ This edition omitted several of the essays included in the English
editions of <cite>Table Talk</cite>, and included several papers which were afterwards published
in England in <cite>The Plain Speaker</cite>. An Advertisement (see notes to this volume)
was prefixed to Vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> In the third edition (2 vols. foolscap 8vo 1845) entitled
‘Table-Talk: Original Essays on Men and Manners. By William Hazlitt.
Edited by his Son. London: C. Templeman, 6, Great Portland Street,’ some
essays were omitted, the order of the essays was altered, and two essays,  ‘On
Travelling Abroad’ and ‘On the Spirit of Controversy,’ were added. The fourth
edition (1857–1861) is a reprint or a re-issue of the third. In the fifth edition
(1 volume 8vo, 1869, Bell &amp; Daldy), edited by Mr. William Carew Hazlitt, the
text and arrangement of the first two editions are restored, but the essays are
divided into three Series. In a later edition edited by Mr. Hazlitt (1 vol. 8vo
Bohn’s Library, 1891) the essays are arranged continuously.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>ESSAY I<br /> <span class='small'>ON THE PLEASURE OF PAINTING</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>‘There is a pleasure in painting which none but painters know.’
In writing, you have to contend with the world; in painting, you
have only to carry on a friendly strife with Nature. You sit down
to your task, and are happy. From the moment that you take up the
pencil, and look Nature in the face, you are at peace with your own
heart. No angry passions rise to disturb the silent progress of the
work, to shake the hand, or dim the brow: no irritable humours are
set afloat: you have no absurd opinions to combat, no point to strain,
no adversary to crush, no fool to annoy—you are actuated by fear or
favour to no man. There is ‘no juggling here,’ no sophistry, no
intrigue, no tampering with the evidence, no attempt to make black
white, or white black: but you resign yourself into the hands of a
greater power, that of Nature, with the simplicity of a child, and the
devotion of an enthusiast—’study with joy her manner, and with
rapture taste her style.’ The mind is calm, and full at the same time.
The hand and eye are equally employed. In tracing the commonest
object, a plant or the stump of a tree, you learn something every
moment. You perceive unexpected differences, and discover likenesses
where you looked for no such thing. You try to set down
what you see—find out your error, and correct it. You need not
play tricks, or purposely mistake: with all your pains, you are still
far short of the mark. Patience grows out of the endless pursuit, and
turns it into a luxury. A streak in a flower, a wrinkle in a leaf, a
tinge in a cloud, a stain in an old wall or ruin grey, are seized with
avidity as the <em>spolia opima</em> of this sort of mental warfare, and furnish
out labour for another half day. The hours pass away untold, without
chagrin, and without weariness; nor would you ever wish to pass
them otherwise. Innocence is joined with industry, pleasure with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>business; and the mind is satisfied, though it is not engaged in
thinking or in doing any mischief.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>I have not much pleasure in writing these Essays, or in reading
them afterwards; though I own I now and then meet with a phrase
that I like, or a thought that strikes me as a true one. But after I
begin them, I am only anxious to get to the end of them, which I am
not sure I shall do, for I seldom see my way a page or even a sentence
beforehand; and when I have as by a miracle escaped, I trouble
myself little more about them. I sometimes have to write them
twice over: then it is necessary to read the <em>proof</em>, to prevent mistakes
by the printer; so that by the time they appear in a tangible
shape, and one can con them over with a conscious, sidelong glance
to the public approbation, they have lost their gloss and relish, and
become ‘more tedious than a twice-told tale.’ For a person to read
his own works over with any great delight, he ought first to forget
that he ever wrote them. Familiarity naturally breeds contempt.
It is, in fact, like poring fondly over a piece of blank paper: from
repetition, the words convey no distinct meaning to the mind, are
mere idle sounds, except that our vanity claims an interest and property
in them. I have more satisfaction in my own thoughts than in
dictating them to others: words are necessary to explain the impression
of certain things upon me to the reader, but they rather weaken
and draw a veil over than strengthen it to myself. However I might
say with the poet, ‘My mind to me a kingdom is,’ yet I have little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>ambition ‘to set a throne or chair of state in the understandings of
other men.’ The ideas we cherish most, exist best in a kind of
shadowy abstraction,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Pure in the last recesses of the mind;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and derive neither force nor interest from being exposed to public
view. They are old familiar acquaintance, and any change in them,
arising from the adventitious ornaments of style or dress, is little to
their advantage. After I have once written on a subject, it goes out
of my mind: my feelings about it have been melted down into words,
and <em>them</em> I forget. I have, as it were, discharged my memory of its
old habitual reckoning, and rubbed out the score of real sentiment.
For the future, it exists only for the sake of others.—But I cannot
say, from my own experience, that the same process takes place in
transferring our ideas to canvas; they gain more than they lose in the
mechanical transformation. One is never tired of painting, because
you have to set down not what you knew already, but what you have
just discovered. In the former case, you translate feelings into
words; in the latter, names into things. There is a continual creation
out of nothing going on. With every stroke of the brush, a new
field of inquiry is laid open; new difficulties arise, and new triumphs
are prepared over them. By comparing the imitation with the
original, you see what you have done, and how much you have still
to do. The test of the senses is severer than that of fancy, and an
over-match even for the delusions of our self-love. One part of a
picture shames another, and you determine to paint up to yourself, if
you cannot come up to nature. Every object becomes lustrous from
the light thrown back upon it by the mirror of art: and by the aid of
the pencil we may be said to touch and handle the objects of sight.
The air-drawn visions that hover on the verge of existence have a
bodily presence given them on the canvas: the form of beauty is
changed into a substance: the dream and the glory of the universe
is made ‘palpable to feeling as to sight.’—And see! a rainbow starts
from the canvas, with all its humid train of glory, as if it were drawn
from its cloudy arch in heaven. The spangled landscape glitters with
drops of dew after the shower. The ‘fleecy fools’ show their coats
in the gleams of the setting sun. The shepherds pipe their farewell
notes in the fresh evening air. And is this bright vision made from
a dead dull blank, like a bubble reflecting the mighty fabric of the
universe? Who would think this miracle of Rubens’ pencil possible
to be performed? Who, having seen it, would not spend his life to
do the like? See how the rich fallows, the bare stubble-field, the
scanty harvest-home, drag in Rembrandt’s landscapes! How often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>have I looked at them and nature, and tried to do the same, till the
very ‘light thickened,’ and there was an earthiness in the feeling of
the air! There is no end of the refinements of art and nature in this
respect. One may look at the misty glimmering horizon till the eye
dazzles and the imagination is lost, in hopes to transfer the whole
interminable expanse at one blow upon canvas. Wilson said, he used
to try to paint the effect of the motes dancing in the setting sun. At
another time, a friend coming into his painting-room when he was
sitting on the ground in a melancholy posture, observed that his
picture looked like a landscape after a shower: he started up with
the greatest delight, and said, ‘That is the effect I intended to produce,
but thought I had failed.’ Wilson was neglected; and, by
degrees, neglected his art to apply himself to brandy. His hand
became unsteady, so that it was only by repeated attempts that he
could reach the place, or produce the effect he aimed at; and when
he had done a little to a picture, he would say to any acquaintance
who chanced to drop in, ‘I have painted enough for one day: come,
let us go somewhere.’ It was not so Claude left his pictures, or his
studies on the banks of the Tiber, to go in search of other enjoyments,
or ceased to gaze upon the glittering sunny vales and distant
hills; and while his eye drank in the clear sparkling hues and lovely
forms of nature, his hand stamped them on the lucid canvas to last
there for ever!—One of the most delightful parts of my life was one
fine summer, when I used to walk out of an evening to catch the last
light of the sun, gemming the green slopes or russet lawns, and gilding
tower or tree, while the blue sky gradually turning to purple and gold,
or skirted with dusky grey, hung its broad marble pavement over all,
as we see it in the great master of Italian landscape. But to come to
a more particular explanation of the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first head I ever tried to paint was an old woman with the
upper part of the face shaded by her bonnet, and I certainly laboured
it with great perseverance. It took me numberless sittings to do it.
I have it by me still, and sometimes look at it with surprise, to think
how much pains were thrown away to little purpose,—yet not
altogether in vain if it taught me to see good in every thing, and to
know that there is nothing vulgar in nature seen with the eye of
science or of true art. Refinement creates beauty everywhere: it
is the grossness of the spectator that discovers nothing but grossness
in the object. Be this as it may, I spared no pains to do my best.
If art was long, I thought that life was so too at that moment. I
got in the general effect the first day; and pleased and surprised
enough I was at my success. The rest was a work of time—of
weeks and months (if need were) of patient toil and careful finishing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>I had seen an old head by Rembrandt at Burleigh-House, and if I
could produce a head at all like Rembrandt in a year, in my life-time,
it would be glory and felicity, and wealth and fame enough for me!
The head I had seen at Burleigh was an exact and wonderful fac-simile
of nature, and I resolved to make mine (as nearly as I could)
an exact fac-simile of nature. I did not then, nor do I now believe,
with Sir Joshua, that the perfection of art consists in giving general
appearances without individual details, but in giving general appearances
with individual details. Otherwise, I had done my work the
first day. But I saw something more in nature than general effect,
and I thought it worth my while to give it in the picture. There
was a gorgeous effect of light and shade: but there was a delicacy as
well as depth in the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro scuro</span></i>, which I was bound to follow into
all its dim and scarce perceptible variety of tone and shadow. Then
I had to make the transition from a strong light to as dark a shade,
preserving the masses, but gradually softening off the intermediate
parts. It was so in nature: the difficulty was to make it so in the
copy. I tried, and failed again and again; I strove harder, and
succeeded as I thought. The wrinkles in Rembrandt were not hard
lines; but broken and irregular. I saw the same appearance in
nature, and strained every nerve to give it. If I could hit off this
edgy appearance, and insert the reflected light in the furrows of old
age in half a morning, I did not think I had lost a day. Beneath
the shrivelled yellow parchment look of the skin, there was here and
there a streak of the blood colour tinging the face; this I made a
point of conveying, and did not cease to compare what I saw with
what I did (with jealous lynx-eyed watchfulness) till I succeeded to
the best of my ability and judgment. How many revisions were
there! How many attempts to catch an expression which I had
seen the day before! How often did we try to get the old position,
and wait for the return of the same light! There was a puckering
up of the lips, a cautious introversion of the eye under the shadow of
the bonnet, indicative of the feebleness and suspicion of old age,
which at last we managed, after many trials and some quarrels, to a
tolerable nicety. The picture was never finished, and I might have
gone on with it to the present hour.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> I used to set it on the ground
when my day’s work was done, and saw revealed to me with swimming
eyes the birth of new hopes, and of a new world of objects.
The painter thus learns to look at nature with different eyes. He
before saw her ‘as in a glass darkly, but now face to face.’ He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>understands the texture and meaning of the visible universe, and ‘sees
into the life of things,’ not by the help of mechanical instruments,
but of the improved exercise of his faculties, and an intimate sympathy
with nature. The meanest thing is not lost upon him, for he looks
at it with an eye to itself, not merely to his own vanity or interest,
or the opinion of the world. Even where there is neither beauty nor
use—if that ever were—still there is truth, and a sufficient source of
gratification in the indulgence of curiosity and activity of mind. The
humblest painter is a true scholar; and the best of scholars—the
scholar of nature. For myself, and for the real comfort and satisfaction
of the thing, I had rather have been Jan Steen, or Gerard
Dow, than the greatest casuist or philologer that ever lived. The
painter does not view things in clouds or ‘mist, the common gloss of
theologians,’ but applies the same standard of truth and disinterested
spirit of inquiry, that influence his daily practice, to other subjects.
He perceives form, he distinguishes character. He reads men and
books with an intuitive eye. He is a critic as well as a connoisseur.
The conclusions he draws are clear and convincing, because they are
taken from the things themselves. He is not a fanatic, a dupe, or a
slave: for the habit of seeing for himself also disposes him to judge
for himself. The most sensible men I know (taken as a class) are
painters; that is, they are the most lively observers of what passes in
the world about them, and the closest observers of what passes in
their own minds. From their profession they in general mix more
with the world than authors; and if they have not the same fund of
acquired knowledge, are obliged to rely more on individual sagacity.
I might mention the names of Opie, Fuseli, Northcote, as persons
distinguished for striking description and acquaintance with the subtle
traits of character.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Painters in ordinary society, or in obscure
situations where their value is not known, and they are treated with
neglect and indifference, have sometimes a forward self-sufficiency of
manner: but this is not so much their fault as that of others. Perhaps
their want of regular education may also be in fault in such cases.
Richardson, who is very tenacious of the respect in which the profession
ought to be held, tells a story of Michael Angelo, that after a
quarrel between him and Pope Julius <span class='fss'>II.</span> ‘upon account of a slight the
artist conceived the pontiff had put upon him, Michael Angelo was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>introduced by a bishop, who, thinking to serve the artist by it, made
it an argument that the Pope should be reconciled to him, because
men of his profession were commonly ignorant, and of no consequence
otherwise: his holiness, enraged at the bishop, struck him with his
staff, and told him, it was he that was the blockhead, and affronted
the man himself would not offend; the prelate was driven out of the
chamber, and Michael Angelo had the Pope’s benediction accompanied
with presents. This bishop had fallen into the vulgar error,
and was rebuked accordingly.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides the exercise of the mind, painting exercises the body. It
is a mechanical as well as a liberal art. To do any thing, to dig a
hole in the ground, to plant a cabbage, to hit a mark, to move a
shuttle, to work a pattern,—in a word, to attempt to produce any
effect, and to <em>succeed</em>, has something in it that gratifies the love of
power, and carries off the restless activity of the mind of man.
Indolence is a delightful but distressing state: we must be doing
something to be happy. Action is no less necessary than thought to
the instinctive tendencies of the human frame; and painting combines
them both incessantly.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The hand furnishes a practical test of the
correctness of the eye; and the eye thus admonished, imposes fresh
tasks of skill and industry upon the hand. Every stroke tells, as the
verifying of a new truth; and every new observation, the instant it is
made, passes into an act and emanation of the will. Every step is
nearer what we wish, and yet there is always more to do. In spite
of the facility, the fluttering grace, the evanescent hues, that play
round the pencil of Rubens and Vandyke, however I may admire,
I do not envy them this power so much as I do the slow, patient,
laborious execution of Correggio, Leonardo da Vinci, and Andrea
del Sarto, where every touch appears conscious of its charge, emulous
of truth, and where the painful artist has so distinctly wrought,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That you might almost say his picture thought!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the one case, the colours seem breathed on the canvas as by
magic, the work and the wonder of a moment: in the other, they
seem inlaid in the body of the work, and as if it took the artist years
of unremitting labour, and of delightful never-ending progress to perfection.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
Who would wish ever to come to the close of such works,—not
to dwell on them, to return to them, to be wedded to them to
the last? Rubens, with his florid, rapid style, complained that when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>he had just learned his art, he should be forced to die. Leonardo,
in the slow advances of his, had lived long enough!</p>

<p class='c013'>Painting is not, like writing, what is properly understood by a
sedentary employment. It requires not indeed a strong, but a continued
and steady exertion of muscular power. The precision and
delicacy of the manual operation makes up for the want of vehemence,—as
to balance himself for any time in the same position the rope-dancer
must strain every nerve. Painting for a whole morning gives
one as excellent an appetite for one’s dinner, as old Abraham Tucker
acquired for his by riding over Banstead Downs. It is related of
Sir Joshua Reynolds, that ‘he took no other exercise than what he
used in his painting-room,’—the writer means, in walking backwards
and forwards to look at his picture; but the act of painting itself, of
laying on the colours in the proper place, and proper quantity, was a
much harder exercise than this alternate receding from and returning
to the picture. This last would be rather a relaxation and relief than
an effort. It is not to be wondered at, that an artist like Sir Joshua,
who delighted so much in the sensual and practical part of his art,
should have found himself at a considerable loss when the decay of
his sight precluded him, for the last year or two of his life, from the
following up of his profession,—‘the source,’ according to his own
remark, ‘of thirty years uninterrupted enjoyment and prosperity to
him.’ It is only those who never think at all, or else who have
accustomed themselves to brood incessantly on abstract ideas, that
never feel <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>To give one instance more, and then I will have done with this
rambling discourse. One of my first attempts was a picture of my
father, who was then in a green old age, with strong-marked features,
and scarred with the small-pox. I drew it with a broad light crossing
the face, looking down, with spectacles on, reading. The book
was Shaftesbury’s Characteristics, in a fine old binding, with Gribelin’s
etchings. My father would as lieve it had been any other book;
but for him to read was to be content, was ‘riches fineless.’ The
sketch promised well; and I set to work to finish it, determined to
spare no time nor pains. My father was willing to sit as long as I
pleased; for there is a natural desire in the mind of man to sit for
one’s picture, to be the object of continued attention, to have one’s
likeness multiplied; and besides his satisfaction in the picture, he
had some pride in the artist, though he would rather I should have
written a sermon than painted like Rembrandt or like Raphael.
Those winter days, with the gleams of sunshine coming through the
chapel-windows, and cheered by the notes of the robin-redbreast in
our garden (that ‘ever in the haunch of winter sings’)—as my afternoon’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>work drew to a close,—were among the happiest of my life.
When I gave the effect I intended to any part of the picture for
which I had prepared my colours, when I imitated the roughness of
the skin by a lucky stroke of the pencil, when I hit the clear pearly
tone of a vein, when I gave the ruddy complexion of health, the
blood circulating under the broad shadows of one side of the face, I
thought my fortune made; or rather it was already more than made,
in my fancying that I might one day be able to say with Correggio,
‘<em>I also am a painter!</em>’ It was an idle thought, a boy’s conceit; but
it did not make me less happy at the time. I used regularly to set
my work in the chair to look at it through the long evenings; and
many a time did I return to take leave of it before I could go to bed
at night. I remember sending it with a throbbing heart to the
Exhibition, and seeing it hung up there by the side of one of the
Honourable Mr. Skeffington (now Sir George). There was
nothing in common between them, but that they were the portraits
of two very good-natured men. I think, but am not sure, that I
finished this portrait (or another afterwards) on the same day that
the news of the battle of Austerlitz came; I walked out in the
afternoon, and, as I returned, saw the evening star set over a poor
man’s cottage with other thoughts and feelings than I shall ever
have again. Oh for the revolution of the great Platonic year, that
those times might come over again! I could sleep out the three
hundred and sixty-five thousand intervening years very contentedly!—The
picture is left: the table, the chair, the window where I
learned to construe Livy, the chapel where my father preached,
remain where they were; but he himself is gone to rest, full of
years, of faith, of hope, and charity!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY II<br /> <span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>The painter not only takes a delight in nature, he has a new and
exquisite source of pleasure opened to him in the study and contemplation
of works of art—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Whate’er Lorraine light touch’d with soft’ning hue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or savage Rosa dash’d, or learned Poussin drew.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He turns aside to view a country-gentleman’s seat with eager looks,
thinking it may contain some of the rich products of art. There is
an air round Lord Radnor’s park, for there hang the two Claudes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the Morning and Evening of the Roman Empire—round Wilton-house,
for there is Vandyke’s picture of the Pembroke family—round
Blenheim, for there is his picture of the Duke of Buckingham’s
children, and the most magnificent collection of Rubenses in the
world—at Knowsley, for there is Rembrandt’s Hand-writing on
the Wall—and at Burleigh, for there are some of Guido’s angelic
heads. The young artist makes a pilgrimage to each of these places,
eyes them wistfully at a distance, ‘bosomed high in tufted trees,’
and feels an interest in them of which the owner is scarce conscious:
he enters the well-swept walks and echoing arch-ways, passes the
threshold, is led through wainscoted rooms, is shown the furniture,
the rich hangings, the tapestry, the massy services of plate—and, at
last, is ushered into the room where his treasure is, the idol of his
vows—some speaking face or bright landscape! It is stamped on
his brain, and lives there thenceforward, a tally for nature, and a
test of art. He furnishes out the chambers of the mind from the
spoils of time, picks and chooses which shall have the best places—nearest
his heart. He goes away richer than he came, richer than
the possessor; and thinks that he may one day return, when he
perhaps shall have done something like them, or even from failure
shall have learned to admire truth and genius more.</p>

<p class='c013'>My first initiation in the mysteries of the art was at the Orleans
Gallery: it was there I formed my taste, such as it is; so that I
am irreclaimably of the old school in painting. I was staggered
when I saw the works there collected, and looked at them with
wondering and with longing eyes. A mist passed away from my
sight: the scales fell off. A new sense came upon me, a new
heaven and a new earth stood before me. I saw the soul speaking
in the face—‘hands that the rod of empire had swayed’ in mighty
ages past—‘a forked mountain or blue promontory,’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>‘—with trees upon ‘t</div>
      <div class='line'>That nod unto the world, and mock our eyes with air.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Old Time had unlocked his treasures, and Fame stood portress at
the door. We had all heard of the names of Titian, Raphael,
Guido, Domenichino, the Caracci—but to see them face to face, to
be in the same room with their deathless productions, was like
breaking some mighty spell—was almost an effect of necromancy!
From that time I lived in a world of pictures. Battles, sieges,
speeches in parliament seemed mere idle noise and fury, ‘signifying
nothing,’ compared with those mighty works and dreaded names
that spoke to me in the eternal silence of thought. This was the
more remarkable, as it was but a short time before that I was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>only totally ignorant of, but insensible to the beauties of art. As an
instance, I remember that one afternoon I was reading the Provoked
Husband with the highest relish, with a green woody landscape of
Ruysdael or Hobbima just before me, at which I looked off the
book now and then, and wondered what there could be in that sort
of work to satisfy or delight the mind—at the same time asking
myself, as a speculative question, whether I should ever feel an
interest in it like what I took in reading Vanbrugh and Cibber?</p>

<p class='c013'>I had made some progress in painting when I went to the Louvre
to study, and I never did any thing afterwards. I never shall forget
conning over the Catalogue which a friend lent me just before I set
out. The pictures, the names of the painters, seemed to relish in
the mouth. There was one of Titian’s Mistress at her toilette.
Even the colours with which the painter had adorned her hair were
not more golden, more amiable to sight, than those which played
round and tantalised my fancy ere I saw the picture. There were
two portraits by the same hand—‘A young Nobleman with a glove’—Another,
‘a companion to it’—I read the description over and
over with fond expectancy, and filled up the imaginary outline with
whatever I could conceive of grace, and dignity, and an antique <em>gusto</em>—all
but equal to the original. There was the Transfiguration too.
With what awe I saw it in my mind’s eye, and was overshadowed
with the spirit of the artist! Not to have been disappointed with
these works afterwards, was the highest compliment I can pay to
their transcendant merits. Indeed, it was from seeing other works
of the same great masters that I had formed a vague, but no disparaging
idea of these.—The first day I got there, I was kept for
some time in the French Exhibition-room, and thought I should not
be able to get a sight of the old masters. I just caught a peep at
them through the door (vile hindrance!) like looking out of
purgatory into paradise—from Poussin’s noble mellow-looking landscapes
to where Rubens hung out his gaudy banner, and down the
glimmering vista to the rich jewels of Titian and the Italian school.
At last, by much importunity, I was admitted, and lost not an instant
in making use of my new privilege.—It was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un beau jour</span></i> to me. I
marched delighted through a quarter of a mile of the proudest efforts
of the mind of man, a whole creation of genius, a universe of art!
I ran the gauntlet of all the schools from the bottom to the top;
and in the end got admitted into the inner room, where they had
been repairing some of their greatest works. Here the Transfiguration,
the St. Peter Martyr, and the St. Jerome of Domenichino
stood on the floor, as if they had bent their knees, like camels
stooping, to unlade their riches to the spectator. On one side, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>an easel, stood Hippolito de Medici (a portrait by Titian) with a
boar-spear in his hand, looking through those he saw, till you turned
away from the keen glance: and thrown together in heaps were
landscapes of the same hand, green pastoral hills and vales, and
shepherds piping to their mild mistresses underneath the flowering
shade. Reader, ‘if thou hast not seen the Louvre, thou art
damned!’—for thou hast not seen the choicest remains of the works
of art; or thou hast not seen all these together, with their mutually
reflected glories. I say nothing of the statues; for I know but
little of sculpture, and never liked any till I saw the Elgin marbles....
Here, for four months together, I strolled and studied, and
daily heard the warning sound—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quatre heures passées, il faut fermer,
Citoyens</span></i>,’ (ah! why did they ever change their style?) muttered in
coarse provincial French; and brought away with me some loose
draughts and fragments, which I have been forced to part with, like
drops of life-blood, for ‘hard money.’ How often, thou tenantless
mansion of godlike magnificence—how often has my heart since gone
a pilgrimage to thee!</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been made a question, whether the artist, or the mere man
of taste and natural sensibility, receives most pleasure from the contemplation
of works of art? and I think this question might be
answered by another as a sort of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</span></i>, namely, whether
any one out of that ‘number numberless’ of mere gentlemen and
amateurs, who visited Paris at the period here spoken of, felt as much
interest, as much pride or pleasure in this display of the most striking
monuments of art as the humblest student would? The first entrance
into the Louvre would be only one of the events of his journey, not
an event in his life, remembered ever after with thankfulness and
regret. He would explore it with the same unmeaning curiosity
and idle wonder as he would the Regalia in the Tower, or the
Botanic Garden in the Thuilleries, but not with the fond enthusiasm
of an artist. How should he? His is ‘casual fruition, joyless,
unendeared.’ But the painter is wedded to his art, the mistress,
queen, and idol of his soul. He has embarked his all in it, fame,
time, fortune, peace of mind, his hopes in youth, his consolation in
age: and shall he not feel a more intense interest in whatever relates
to it than the mere indolent trifler? Natural sensibility alone, without
the entire application of the mind to that one object, will not enable
the possessor to sympathise with all the degrees of beauty and power
in the conception of a Titian or a Correggio; but it is he only who
does this, who follows them into all their force and matchless grace,
that does or can feel their full value. Knowledge is pleasure as well
as power. No one but the artist who has studied nature and contended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>with the difficulties of art, can be aware of the beauties, or
intoxicated with a passion for painting. No one who has not devoted
his life and soul to the pursuit of art, can feel the same exultation in
its brightest ornaments and loftiest triumphs which an artist does.
Where the treasure is, there the heart is also. It is now seventeen
years since I was studying in the Louvre (and I have long since
given up all thoughts of the art as a profession), but long after I
returned, and even still, I sometimes dream of being there again—of
asking for the old pictures—and not finding them, or finding them
changed or faded from what they were, I cry myself awake! What
gentleman-amateur ever does this at such a distance of time,—that is,
ever received pleasure or took interest enough in them to produce so
lasting an impression?</p>

<p class='c013'>But it is said that if a person had the same natural taste, and the
same acquired knowledge as an artist, without the petty interests and
technical notions, he would derive a purer pleasure from seeing a fine
portrait, a fine landscape, and so on. This however is not so much
begging the question as asking an impossibility: he cannot have the
same insight into the end without having studied the means; nor
the same love of art without the same habitual and exclusive attachment
to it. Painters are, no doubt, often actuated by jealousy,
partiality, and a sordid attention to that only which they find useful
to themselves in painting. W— has been seen poring over the
texture of a Dutch cabinet-picture, so that he could not see the picture
itself. But this is the perversion and pedantry of the profession, not
its true or genuine spirit. If W— had never looked at any thing
but megilps and handling, he never would have put the soul of life
and manners into his pictures, as he has done. Another objection is,
that the instrumental parts of the art, the means, the first rudiments,
paints, oils, and brushes, are painful and disgusting; and that the
consciousness of the difficulty and anxiety with which perfection has
been attained, must take away from the pleasure of the finest performance.
This, however, is only an additional proof of the greater
pleasure derived by the artist from his profession; for these things
which are said to interfere with and destroy the common interest in
works of art, do not disturb him; he never once thinks of them, he
is absorbed in the pursuit of a higher object; he is intent, not on the
means but the end; he is taken up, not with the difficulties, but with
the triumph over them. As in the case of the anatomist, who overlooks
many things in the eagerness of his search after abstract truth;
or the alchemist who, while he is raking into his soot and furnaces,
lives in a golden dream; a lesser gives way to a greater object. But
it is pretended that the painter may be supposed to submit to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>unpleasant part of the process only for the sake of the fame or profit
in view. So far is this from being a true state of the case, that I will
venture to say, in the instance of a friend of mine who has lately
succeeded in an important undertaking in his art, that not all the
fame he has acquired, not all the money he has received from thousands
of admiring spectators, not all the newspaper puffs,—nor even the
praise of the Edinburgh Review,—not all these, put together, ever
gave him at any time the same genuine, undoubted satisfaction as any
one half-hour employed in the ardent and propitious pursuit of his art—in
finishing to his heart’s content a foot, a hand, or even a piece of
drapery. What is the state of mind of an artist while he is at work?
He is then in the act of realising the highest idea he can form of
beauty or grandeur: he conceives, he embodies that which he understands
and loves best: that is, he is in full and perfect possession of
that which is to him the source of the highest happiness and intellectual
excitement which he can enjoy.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short, as a conclusion to this argument, I will mention a circumstance
which fell under my knowledge the other day. A friend had
bought a print of Titian’s Mistress, the same to which I have alluded
above. He was anxious to shew it me on this account. I told
him it was a spirited engraving, but it had not the look of the original.
I believe he thought this fastidious, till I offered to shew him a rough
sketch of it, which I had by me. Having seen this, he said he
perceived exactly what I meant, and could not bear to look at the
print afterwards. He had good sense enough to see the difference
in the individual instance; but a person better acquainted with
Titian’s manner and with art in general, that is, of a more cultivated
and refined taste, would know that it was a bad print, without having
any immediate model to compare it with. He would perceive with
a glance of the eye, with a sort of instinctive feeling, that it was hard,
and without that bland, expansive, and nameless expression which
always distinguished Titian’s most famous works. Any one who is
accustomed to a head in a picture can never reconcile himself to a
print from it: but to the ignorant they are both the same. To
a vulgar eye there is no difference between a Guido and a daub,
between a penny-print or the vilest scrawl, and the most finished
performance. In other words, all that excellence which lies between
these two extremes,—all, at least, that marks the excess above
mediocrity,—all that constitutes true beauty, harmony, refinement,
grandeur, is lost upon the common observer. But it is from this
point that the delight, the glowing raptures of the true adept commence.
An uninformed spectator may like an ordinary drawing better than
the ablest connoisseur; but for that very reason he cannot like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>highest specimens of art so well. The refinements not only of execution
but of truth and nature are inaccessible to unpractised eyes. The
exquisite gradations in a sky of Claude’s are not perceived by such
persons, and consequently the harmony cannot be felt. Where there
is no conscious apprehension, there can be no conscious pleasure.
Wonder at the first sight of works of art may be the effect of ignorance
and novelty; but real admiration and permanent delight in them are
the growth of taste and knowledge. ‘I would not wish to have your
eyes,’ said a good-natured man to a critic, who was finding fault with
a picture, in which the other saw no blemish. Why so? The
idea which prevented him from admiring this inferior production was
a higher idea of truth and beauty which was ever present with him,
and a continual source of pleasing and lofty contemplations. It may
be different in a taste for outward luxuries and the privations of mere
sense; but the idea of perfection, which acts as an intellectual foil, is
always an addition, a support, and a proud consolation!</p>

<p class='c013'>Richardson, in his Essays, which ought to be better known, has
left some striking examples of the felicity and infelicity of artists, both
as it relates to their external fortune, and to the practice of their art.
In speaking of <em>the knowledge of hands</em>, he exclaims—‘When one is
considering a picture or a drawing, one at the same time thinks this
was done by him<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> who had many extraordinary endowments of body
and mind, but was withal very capricious; who was honoured in life
and death, expiring in the arms of one of the greatest princes of that
age, Francis <span class='fss'>I.</span> King of France, who loved him as a friend. Another
is of him<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> who lived a long and happy life, beloved of Charles <span class='fss'>V.</span>
emperour; and many others of the first princes of Europe. When
one has another in hand, we think this was done by one<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> who so
excelled in three arts, as that any of them in that degree had rendered
him worthy of immortality; and one moreover that durst contend
with his sovereign (one of the haughtiest popes that ever was) upon
a slight offered to him, and extricated himself with honour. Another
is the work of him<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> who, without any one exterior advantage but
mere strength of genius, had the most sublime imaginations, and
executed them accordingly, yet lived and died obscurely. Another
we shall consider as the work of him<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a> who restored Painting when
it had almost sunk; of him whom art made honourable, but who,
neglecting and despising greatness with a sort of cynical pride, was
treated suitably to the figure he gave himself, not his intrinsic worth;
which, not having philosophy enough to bear it, broke his heart.
Another is done by one<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a> who (on the contrary) was a fine gentleman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and lived in great magnificence, and was much honoured by his own
and foreign princes; who was a courtier, a statesman, and a painter;
and so much all these, that when he acted in either character, <em>that</em>
seemed to be his business, and the others his diversion. I say when
one thus reflects, besides the pleasure arising from the beauties and
excellences of the work, the fine ideas it gives us of natural things,
the noble way of thinking it may suggest to us, an additional pleasure
results from the above considerations. But, oh! the pleasure, when
a connoisseur and lover of art has before him a picture or drawing, of
which he can say this is the hand, these are the thoughts of him<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
who was one of the politest, best-natured gentlemen that ever was;
and beloved and assisted by the greatest wits and the greatest men
then in Rome: of him who lived in great fame, honour, and magnificence,
and died extremely lamented; and missed a Cardinal’s hat
only by dying a few months too soon; but was particularly esteemed
and favoured by two Popes, the only ones who filled the chair of
St. Peter in his time, and as great men as ever sat there since that
apostle, if at least he ever did: one, in short, who could have been a
Leonardo, a Michael Angelo, a Titian, a Correggio, a Parmegiano,
an Annibal, a Rubens, or any other whom he pleased, but none of
them could ever have been a Rafaelle.’ Page 251.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same writer speaks feelingly of the change in the style of
different artists from their change of fortune, and as the circumstances
are little known, I will quote the passage relating to two of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Guido Reni from a prince-like affluence of fortune (the just
reward of his angelic works) fell to a condition like that of a hired
servant to one who supplied him with money for what he did at a
fixed rate; and that by his being bewitched with a passion for gaming,
whereby he lost vast sums of money; and even what he got in this
his state of servitude by day, he commonly lost at night: nor could
he ever be cured of this cursed madness. Those of his works, therefore,
which he did in this unhappy part of his life, may easily be
conceived to be in a different style to what he did before, which in
some things, that is, in the airs of his heads (in the gracious kind), had
a delicacy in them peculiar to himself, and almost more than human.
But I must not multiply instances. Parmegiano is one that alone
takes in all the several kinds of variation, and all the degrees of
goodness, from the lowest of the indifferent up to the sublime. I can
produce evident proofs of this in so easy a gradation, that one cannot
deny but that he that did this, might do that, and very probably did
so; and thus one may ascend and descend, like the angels on Jacob’s
ladder, whose foot was upon the earth, but its top reached to Heaven.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>‘And this great man had his unlucky circumstance: he became
mad after the philosopher’s stone, and did but very little in painting
or drawing afterwards. Judge what that was, and whether there
was not an alteration of style from what he had done, before this devil
possessed him. His creditors endeavoured to exorcise him, and did
him some good, for he set himself to work again in his own way:
but if a drawing I have of a Lucretia be that he made for his last
picture, as it probably is (Vasari says that was the subject of it), it
is an evident proof of his decay: it is good indeed, but it wants much
of the delicacy which is commonly seen in his works; and so I
always thought before I knew or imagined it to be done in this his
ebb of genius.’ Page 153.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have had two artists of our own country, whose fate has been
as singular as it was hard. Gandy was a portrait-painter in the
beginning of the last century, whose heads were said to have come
near to Rembrandt’s, and he was the undoubted prototype of Sir
Joshua Reynolds’s style. Yet his name has scarcely been heard of;
and his reputation, like his works, never extended beyond his own
county. What did he think of himself and of a fame so bounded!
Did he ever dream he was indeed an artist? Or how did this feeling
in him differ from the vulgar conceit of the lowest pretender? The
best known of his works is a portrait of an alderman of Exeter, in
some public building in that city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Dan. Stringer! Forty years ago he had the finest hand and
the clearest eye of any artist of his time, and produced heads and drawings
that would not have disgraced a brighter period in the art. But
he fell a martyr (like Burns) to the society of country-gentlemen, and
then of those whom they would consider as more his equals. I saw
him many years ago, when he treated the masterly sketches he had
by him (one in particular of the group of citizens in Shakespear
‘swallowing the tailor’s news’) as ‘bastards of his genius, not his
children;’ and seemed to have given up all thoughts of his art.
Whether he is since dead, I cannot say: the world do not so much
as know that he ever lived!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY III<br /> <span class='small'>ON THE PAST AND FUTURE</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>I have naturally but little imagination, and am not of a very sanguine
turn of mind. I have some desire to enjoy the present good, and
some fondness for the past; but I am not at all given to building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>castles in the air, nor to look forward with much confidence or hope
to the brilliant illusions held out by the future. Hence I have
perhaps been led to form a theory, which is very contrary to the
common notions and feelings on the subject, and which I will here
try to explain as well as I can.—When Sterne in the Sentimental
Journey told the French Minister that if the French people had a fault,
it was that they were too serious, the latter replied that if that was
his opinion, he must defend it with all his might, for he would have
all the world against him; so I shall have enough to do to get well
through the present argument.</p>

<p class='c013'>I cannot see, then, any rational or logical ground for that mighty
difference in the value which mankind generally set upon the past and
future, as if the one was every thing, and the other nothing, of no
consequence whatever. On the other hand, I conceive that the past
is as real and substantial a part of our being, that it is as much a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona
fide</span></i>, undeniable consideration in the estimate of human life, as the
future can possibly be. To say that the past is of no importance,
unworthy of a moment’s regard, because it has gone by, and is no
longer any thing, is an argument that cannot be held to any purpose:
for if the past has ceased to be, and is therefore to be accounted
nothing in the scale of good or evil, the future is yet to come, and
has never been any thing. Should any one choose to assert that the
present only is of any value in a strict and positive sense, because that
alone has a real existence, that we should seize the instant good, and
give all else to the winds, I can understand what he means (though
perhaps he does not himself<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a>): but I cannot comprehend how this
distinction between that which has a downright and sensible, and that
which has only a remote and airy existence, can be applied to
establish the preference of the future over the past; for both are in
this point of view equally ideal, absolutely nothing, except as they
are conceived of by the mind’s eye, and are thus rendered present to
the thoughts and feelings. Nay, the one is even more imaginary, a
more fantastic creature of the brain than the other, and the interest we
take in it more shadowy and gratuitous; for the future, on which we
lay so much stress, may never come to pass at all, that is, may never
be embodied into actual existence in the whole course of events,
whereas the past has certainly existed once, has received the stamp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>of truth, and left an image of itself behind. It is so far then placed
beyond the possibility of doubt, or as the poet has it,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Those joys are lodg’d beyond the reach of fate.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It is not, however, attempted to be denied that though the future is
nothing at present, and has no immediate interest while we are speaking,
yet it is of the utmost consequence in itself, and of the utmost
interest to the individual, because it <em>will have</em> a real existence, and
we have an idea of it as existing in time to come. Well then, the
past also has no real existence; the actual sensation and the interest
belonging to it are both fled; but it <em>has had</em> a real existence, and we
can still call up a vivid recollection of it as having once been; and
therefore, by parity of reasoning, it is not a thing perfectly insignificant
in itself, nor wholly indifferent to the mind, whether it ever was or
not. Oh no! Far from it! Let us not rashly quit our hold upon
the past, when perhaps there may be little else left to bind us to
existence. Is it nothing to have been, and to have been happy or
miserable? Or is it a matter of no moment to think whether I have
been one or the other? Do I delude myself, do I build upon a
shadow or a dream, do I dress up in the gaudy garb of idleness and
folly a pure fiction, with nothing answering to it in the universe of
things and the records of truth, when I look back with fond delight
or with tender regret to that which was at one time to me <em>my all</em>,
when I revive the glowing image of some bright reality,</p>

<p class='c015'>Do I then muse on nothing, do I bend my eyes on nothing, when
I turn back in fancy to ‘those suns and skies so pure’ that lighted up
my early path? Is it to think of nothing, to set an idle value upon
nothing, to think of all that has happened to me, and of all that can
ever interest me? Or, to use the language of a fine poet (who is

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>for it is the past that gives me most delight and most assurance of
reality. What to me constitutes the great charm of the Confessions
of Rousseau is their turning so much upon this feeling. He seems
to gather up the past moments of his being like drops of honey-dew
to distil a precious liquor from them; his alternate pleasures and
pains are the beadroll that he tells over, and piously worships; he
makes a rosary of the flowers of hope and fancy that strewed his
earliest years. When he begins the last of the Reveries of a Solitary
Walker, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il y a aujourd’hui, jour des Pâques Fleuris, cinquante ans
depuis que j’ai premier vu Madame Warens</span></i>,’ what a yearning of the
soul is implied in that short sentence! Was all that had happened
to him, all that he had thought and felt in that sad interval of time,
to be accounted nothing? Was that long, dim, faded retrospect of
years happy or miserable, a blank that was not to make his eyes fail
and his heart faint within him in trying to grasp all that had once
filled it and that had since vanished, because it was not a prospect
into futurity? Was he wrong in finding more to interest him in it
than in the next fifty years—which he did not live to see; or if he
had, what then? Would they have been worth thinking of, compared
with the times of his youth, of his first meeting with Madame Warens,
with those times which he has traced with such truth and pure delight
‘in our heart’s tables?’ When ‘all the life of life was flown,’ was
he not to live the first and best part of it over again, and once more
be all that he then was?—Ye woods that crown the clear lone brow
of Norman Court, why do I revisit ye so oft, and feel a soothing
consciousness of your presence, but that your high tops waving in the
wind recal to me the hours and years that are for ever fled, that ye
renew in ceaseless murmurs the story of long-cherished hopes and
bitter disappointment, that in your solitudes and tangled wilds I can
wander and lose myself as I wander on and am lost in the solitude of
my own heart; and that as your rustling branches give the loud blast
to the waste below—borne on the thoughts of other years, I can
look down with patient anguish at the cheerless desolation which I
feel within! Without that face pale as the primrose with hyacinthine
locks, for ever shunning and for ever haunting me, mocking my
waking thoughts as in a dream, without that smile which my heart
could never turn to scorn, without those eyes, dark with their own
lustre, still bent on mine, and drawing the soul into their liquid mazes
like a sea of love, without that name trembling in fancy’s ear, without
that form gliding before me like Oread or Dryad in fabled groves,
what should I do, how pass away the listless leaden-footed hours?
Then wave, wave on, ye woods of Tuderley, and lift your high tops
in the air; my sighs and vows uttered by your mystic voice breathe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>into me my former being, and enable me to bear the thing I am!—The
objects that we have known in better days are the main props
that sustain the weight of our affections, and give us strength to await
our future lot. The future is like a dead wall or a thick mist hiding
all objects from our view: the past is alive and stirring with objects,
bright or solemn, and of unfading interest. What is it in fact that
we recur to oftenest? What subjects do we think or talk of? Not
the ignorant future, but the well-stored past. Othello, the Moor of
Venice, amused himself and his hearers at the house of Signor
Brabantio by ‘running through the story of his life even from his
boyish days;’ and oft ‘beguiled them of their tears, when he did
speak of some disastrous stroke which his youth suffered.’ This
plan of ingratiating himself would not have answered, if the past
had been, like the contents of an old almanac, of no use but to
be thrown aside and forgotten. What a blank, for instance, does
the history of the world for the next six thousand years present
to the mind, compared with that of the last! All that strikes the
imagination or excites any interest in the mighty scene is <em>what has been</em>!<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Neither in itself then, nor as a subject of general contemplation,
has the future any advantage over the past. But with respect to our
grosser passions and pursuits it has. As far as regards the appeal to
the understanding or the imagination, the past is just as good, as real,
of as much intrinsic and ostensible value as the future: but there is
another principle in the human mind, the principle of action or will;
and of this the past has no hold, the future engrosses it entirely to
itself. It is this strong lever of the affections that gives so powerful
a bias to our sentiments on this subject, and violently transposes
the natural order of our associations. We regret the pleasures we
have lost, and eagerly anticipate those which are to come: we dwell
with satisfaction on the evils from which we have escaped (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Posthæc
meminisse juvabit</span></i>)—and dread future pain. The good that is past is
in this sense like money that is spent, which is of no further use, and
about which we give ourselves little concern. The good we expect
is like a store yet untouched, and in the enjoyment of which we
promise ourselves infinite gratification. What has happened to us we
think of no consequence: what is to happen to us, of the greatest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Why so? Simply because the one is still in our power, and the
other not—because the efforts of the will to bring any object to pass
or to prevent it strengthen our attachment or aversion to that
object—because the pains and attention bestowed upon any thing
add to our interest in it, and because the habitual and earnest pursuit
of any end redoubles the ardour of our expectations, and converts the
speculative and indolent satisfaction we might otherwise feel in it into
real passion. Our regrets, anxiety, and wishes are thrown away upon
the past: but the insisting on the importance of the future is of the
utmost use in aiding our resolutions, and stimulating our exertions.
If the future were no more amenable to our wills than the past; if
our precautions, our sanguine schemes, our hopes and fears were of as
little avail in the one case as the other; if we could neither soften
our minds to pleasure, nor steel our fortitude to the resistance of pain
beforehand; if all objects drifted along by us like straws or pieces
of wood in a river, the will being purely passive, and as little able to
avert the future as to arrest the past, we should in that case be equally
indifferent to both; that is, we should consider each as they affected
the thoughts and imagination with certain sentiments of approbation
or regret, but without the importunity of action, the irritation of the
will, throwing the whole weight of passion and prejudice into one
scale, and leaving the other quite empty. While the blow is coming,
we prepare to meet it, we think to ward off or break its force, we
arm ourselves with patience to endure what cannot be avoided, we
agitate ourselves with fifty needless alarms about it; but when the blow
is struck, the pang is over, the struggle is no longer necessary, and
we cease to harass or torment ourselves about it more than we can
help. It is not that the one belongs to the future and the other to
time past; but that the one is a subject of action, of uneasy apprehension,
of strong passion, and that the other has passed wholly out
of the sphere of action, into the region of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Calm contemplation and majestic pains.’<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a></div>
    </div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>It would not give a man more concern to know that he should be
put to the rack a year hence, than to recollect that he had been put
to it a year ago, but that he hopes to avoid the one, whereas he must
sit down patiently under the consciousness of the other. In this hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>he wears himself out in vain struggles with fate, and puts himself to
the rack of his imagination every day he has to live in the mean
while. When the event is so remote or so independent of the will
as to set aside the necessity of immediate action, or to baffle all
attempts to defeat it, it gives us little more disturbance or emotion
than if it had already taken place, or were something to happen in
another state of being, or to an indifferent person. Criminals are
observed to grow more anxious as their trial approaches; but after
their sentence is passed, they become tolerably resigned, and generally
sleep sound the night before its execution.</p>

<p class='c013'>It in some measure confirms this theory, that men attach more or
less importance to past and future events, according as they are more
or less engaged in action and the busy scenes of life. Those who
have a fortune to make, or are in pursuit of rank and power, think
little of the past, for it does not contribute greatly to their views:
those who have nothing to do but to think, take nearly the same
interest in the past as in the future. The contemplation of the one
is as delightful and real as that of the other. The season of hope
has an end; but the remembrance of it is left. The past still lives
in the memory of those who have leisure to look back upon the way
that they have trod, and can from it ‘catch glimpses that may make
them less forlorn.’ The turbulence of action, and uneasiness of
desire, must point to the future: it is only in the quiet innocence
of shepherds, in the simplicity of pastoral ages, that a tomb was found
with this inscription—‘<span class='fss'>I ALSO WAS AN ARCADIAN!</span>’</p>

<p class='c013'>Though I by no means think that our habitual attachment to life
is in exact proportion to the value of the gift, yet I am not one of
those splenetic persons who affect to think it of no value at all.
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que peu de chose est la vie humaine</span></i>—is an exclamation in the mouths
of moralists and philosophers, to which I cannot agree. It is little,
it is short, it is not worth having, if we take the last hour, and leave
out all that has gone before, which has been one way of looking at
the subject. Such calculators seem to say that life is nothing when
it is over, and that may in their sense be true. If the old rule—<em>Respice
finem</em>—were to be made absolute, and no one could be
pronounced fortunate till the day of his death, there are few among
us whose existence would, upon those conditions, be much to be
envied. But this is not a fair view of the case. A man’s life is his
whole life, not the last glimmering snuff of the candle; and this, I
say, is considerable, and not <em>a little matter</em>, whether we regard its
pleasures or its pains. To draw a peevish conclusion to the contrary
from our own superannuated desires or forgetful indifference is about
as reasonable as to say, a man never was young because he is grown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>old, or never lived because he is now dead. The length or agreeableness
of a journey does not depend on the few last steps of it, nor is
the size of a building to be judged of from the last stone that is added
to it. It is neither the first nor last hour of our existence, but the
space that parts these two—not our exit nor our entrance upon the
stage, but what we do, feel, and think while there—that we are to
attend to in pronouncing sentence upon it. Indeed it would be easy
to shew that it is the very extent of human life, the infinite number
of things contained in it, its contradictory and fluctuating interests,
the transition from one situation to another, the hours, months, years
spent in one fond pursuit after another; that it is, in a word, the
length of our common journey and the quantity of events crowded
into it, that, baffling the grasp of our actual perception, make it slide
from our memory, and dwindle into nothing in its own perspective.
It is too mighty for us, and we say it is nothing! It is a speck in
our fancy, and yet what canvas would be big enough to hold its
striking groups, its endless subjects! It is light as vanity, and yet
if all its weary moments, if all its head and heart aches were compressed
into one, what fortitude would not be overwhelmed with the
blow! What a huge heap, a ‘huge, dumb heap,’ of wishes, thoughts,
feelings, anxious cares, soothing hopes, loves, joys, friendships, it is
composed of! How many ideas and trains of sentiment, long and
deep and intense, often pass through the mind in only one day’s
thinking or reading, for instance! How many such days are there
in a year, how many years in a long life, still occupied with something
interesting, still recalling some old impression, still recurring to
some difficult question and making progress in it, every step accompanied
with a sense of power, and every moment conscious of ‘the
high endeavour or the glad success;’ for the mind seizes only on
that which keeps it employed, and is wound up to a certain pitch of
pleasurable excitement or lively solicitude, by the necessity of its own
nature. The division of the map of life into its component parts is
beautifully made by King Henry <span class='fss'>VI.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>The passions contract and warp the natural progress of life. They
paralyse all of it that is not devoted to their tyranny and caprice.
This makes the difference between the laughing innocence of childhood,
the pleasantness of youth, and the crabbedness of age. A load
of cares lies like a weight of guilt upon the mind: so that a man of
business often has all the air, the distraction and restlessness and hurry
of feeling of a criminal. A knowledge of the world takes away the
freedom and simplicity of thought as effectually as the contagion of its
example. The artlessness and candour of our early years are open to
all impressions alike, because the mind is not clogged and pre-occupied
with other objects. Our pleasures and our pains come single, make
room for one another, and the spring of the mind is fresh and unbroken,
its aspect clear and unsullied. Hence ‘the tear forgot as
soon as shed, the sunshine of the breast.’ But as we advance farther,
the will gets greater head. We form violent antipathies, and indulge
exclusive preferences. We make up our minds to some one thing,
and if we cannot have that, will have nothing. We are wedded to
opinion, to fancy, to prejudice; which destroys the soundness of
our judgments, and the serenity and buoyancy of our feelings. The
chain of habit coils itself round the heart, like a serpent, to gnaw and
stifle it. It grows rigid and callous; and for the softness and
elasticity of childhood, full of proud flesh and obstinate tumours.
The violence and perversity of our passions comes in more and more
to overlay our natural sensibility and well-grounded affections; and
we screw ourselves up to aim only at those things which are neither
desirable nor practicable. Thus life passes away in the feverish
irritation of pursuit and the certainty of disappointment. By degrees,
nothing but this morbid state of feeling satisfies us: and all common
pleasures and cheap amusements are sacrificed to the demon of
ambition, avarice, or dissipation. The machine is over-wrought:
the parching heat of the veins dries up and withers the flowers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of Love, Hope, and Joy; and any pause, any release from the rack
of ecstacy on which we are stretched, seems more insupportable than
the pangs which we endure. We are suspended between tormenting
desires, and the horrors of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>. The impulse of the will, like the
wheels of a carriage going down hill, becomes too strong for the
driver, reason, and cannot be stopped nor kept within bounds. Some
idea, some fancy, takes possession of the brain; and however
ridiculous, however distressing, however ruinous, haunts us by a
sort of fascination through life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only is this principle of excessive irritability to be seen at work
in our more turbulent passions and pursuits, but even in the formal
study of arts and sciences, the same thing takes place, and undermines
the repose and happiness of life. The eagerness of pursuit overcomes
the satisfaction to result from the accomplishment. The mind is
overstrained to attain its purpose; and when it is attained, the ease
and alacrity necessary to enjoy it are gone. The irritation of action
does not cease and go down with the occasion for it; but we are first
uneasy to get to the end of our work, and then uneasy for want of
something to do. The ferment of the brain does not of itself subside
into pleasure and soft repose. Hence the disposition to strong <em>stimuli</em>
observable in persons of much intellectual exertion to allay and carry
off the over-excitement. The <em>improvisatori</em> poets (it is recorded by
Spence in his Anecdotes of Pope) cannot sleep after an evening’s
continued display of their singular and difficult art. The rhymes
keep running in their head in spite of themselves, and will not let
them rest. Mechanics and labouring people never know what to do
with themselves on a Sunday, though they return to their work with
greater spirit for the relief, and look forward to it with pleasure all
the week. Sir Joshua Reynolds was never comfortable out of his
painting-room, and died of chagrin and regret, because he could not
paint on to the last moment of his life. He used to say that he could
go on retouching a picture for ever, as long as it stood on his easel;
but as soon as it was once fairly out of the house, he never wished to
see it again. An ingenious artist of our own time has been heard to
declare, that if ever the Devil got him into his clutches, he would set
him to copy his own pictures. Thus the secure self-complacent retrospect
to what is done is nothing, while the anxious, uneasy looking
forward to what is to come is every thing. We are afraid to dwell
upon the past, lest it should retard our future progress; the indulgence
of ease is fatal to excellence; and to succeed in life, we lose the ends
of being!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>ESSAY IV<br /> <span class='small'>ON GENIUS AND COMMON SENSE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We hear it maintained by people of more gravity than understanding,
that genius and taste are strictly reducible to rules, and
that there is a rule for every thing. So far is it from being true
that the finest breath of fancy is a definable thing, that the plainest
common sense is only what Mr. Locke would have called a <em>mixed
mode</em>, subject to a particular sort of acquired and undefinable tact.
It is asked, ‘If you do not know the rule by which a thing is done,
how can you be sure of doing it a second time?’ And the answer
is, ‘If you do not know the muscles by the help of which you walk,
how is it you do not fall down at every step you take?’ In art, in
taste, in life, in speech, you decide from feeling, and not from
reason; that is, from the impression of a number of things on the
mind, which impression is true and well-founded, though you may
not be able to analyse or account for it in the several particulars.
In a gesture you use, in a look you see, in a tone you hear, you
judge of the expression, propriety, and meaning from habit, not
from reason or rules; that is to say, from innumerable instances of
like gestures, looks, and tones, in innumerable other circumstances,
variously modified, which are too many and too refined to be all
distinctly recollected, but which do not therefore operate the less
powerfully upon the mind and eye of taste. Shall we say that these
impressions (the immediate stamp of nature) do not operate in a
given manner till they are classified and reduced to rules, or is not
the rule itself grounded upon the truth and certainty of that natural
operation? How then can the distinction of the understanding as
to the manner in which they operate be necessary to their producing
their due and uniform effect upon the mind? If certain effects did
not regularly arise out of certain causes in mind as well as matter,
there could be no rule given for them: nature does not follow the
rule, but suggests it. Reason is the interpreter and critic of nature
and genius, not their lawgiver and judge. He must be a poor
creature indeed whose practical convictions do not in almost all cases
outrun his deliberate understanding, or who does not feel and know
much more than he can give a reason for.—Hence the distinction
between eloquence and wisdom, between ingenuity and common
sense. A man may be dextrous and able in explaining the grounds
of his opinions, and yet may be a mere sophist, because he only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>sees one half of a subject. Another may feel the whole weight of
a question, nothing relating to it may be lost upon him, and yet he
may be able to give no account of the manner in which it affects
him, or to drag his reasons from their silent lurking-places. This
last will be a wise man, though neither a logician nor rhetorician.
Goldsmith was a fool to Dr. Johnson in argument; that is, in
assigning the specific grounds of his opinions: Dr. Johnson was a
fool to Goldsmith in the fine tact, the airy, intuitive faculty with
which he skimmed the surfaces of things, and unconsciously formed
his opinions. Common sense is the just result of the sum-total of
such unconscious impressions in the ordinary occurrences of life, as
they are treasured up in the memory, and called out by the occasion.
Genius and taste depend much upon the same principle exercised
on loftier ground and in more unusual combinations.</p>

<p class='c013'>I am glad to shelter myself from the charge of affectation or
singularity in this view of an often debated but ill-understood point,
by quoting a passage from Sir Joshua Reynolds’s Discourses, which
is full, and, I think, conclusive to the purpose. He says,</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I observe, as a fundamental ground common to all the Arts with
which we have any concern in this Discourse, that they address
themselves only to two faculties of the mind, its imagination and its
sensibility.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘All theories which attempt to direct or to control the Art, upon
any principles falsely called rational, which we form to ourselves
upon a supposition of what ought in reason to be the end or means
of Art, independent of the known first effect produced by objects
on the imagination, must be false and delusive. For though it may
appear bold to say it, the imagination is here the residence of truth.
If the imagination be affected, the conclusion is fairly drawn; if it
be not affected, the reasoning is erroneous, because the end is not
obtained; the effect itself being the test, and the only test, of the
truth and efficacy of the means.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘There is in the commerce of life, as in Art, a sagacity which
is far from being contradictory to right reason, and is superior to
any occasional exercise of that faculty; which supersedes it; and
does not wait for the slow progress of deduction, but goes at once,
by what appears a kind of intuition, to the conclusion. A man
endowed with this faculty feels and acknowledges the truth, though
it is not always in his power, perhaps, to give a reason for it;
because he cannot recollect and bring before him all the materials
that gave birth to his opinion; for very many and very intricate
considerations may unite to form the principle, even of small and
minute parts, involved in, or dependent on, a great system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>things:—though these in process of time are forgotten, the right
impression still remains fixed in his mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘This impression is the result of the accumulated experience of
our whole life, and has been collected, we do not always know how,
or when. But this mass of collective observation, however acquired,
ought to prevail over that reason, which, however powerfully exerted
on any particular occasion, will probably comprehend but a partial
view of the subject; and our conduct in life, as well as in the arts,
is or ought to be generally governed by this habitual reason: it is
our happiness that we are enabled to draw on such funds. If we
were obliged to enter into a theoretical deliberation on every
occasion before we act, life would be at a stand, and Art would be
impracticable.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘It appears to me therefore’ (continues Sir Joshua) ‘that our
first thoughts, that is, the effect which any thing produces on our
minds, on its first appearance, is never to be forgotten; and it
demands for that reason, because it is the first, to be laid up with
care. If this be not done, the artist may happen to impose on
himself by partial reasoning; by a cold consideration of those
animated thoughts which proceed, not perhaps from caprice or
rashness (as he may afterwards conceit), but from the fulness of
his mind, enriched with the copious stores of all the various
inventions which he had ever seen, or had ever passed in his mind.
These ideas are infused into his design, without any conscious effort;
but if he be not on his guard, he may reconsider and correct them,
till the whole matter is reduced to a common-place invention.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘This is sometimes the effect of what I mean to caution you
against; that is to say, an unfounded distrust of the imagination and
feeling, in favour of narrow, partial, confined, argumentative theories,
and of principles that seem to apply to the design in hand; without
considering those general impressions on the fancy in which real
principles of <em>sound reason</em>, and of much more weight and importance,
are involved, and, as it were, lie hid under the appearance of a sort
of vulgar sentiment. Reason, without doubt, must ultimately determine
every thing; at this minute it is required to inform us when
that very reason is to give way to feeling.’—Discourse <span class='fss'>XIII.</span> vol. ii.
p. 113–17.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Burke, by whom the foregoing train of thinking was probably
suggested, has insisted on the same thing, and made rather a perverse
use of it in several parts of his Reflections on the French Revolution;
and Windham in one of his Speeches has clenched it into an
aphorism—‘There is nothing so true as habit.’ Once more I would
say, common sense is tacit reason. Conscience is the same tacit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>sense of right and wrong, or the impression of our moral experience
and moral apprehensions on the mind, which, because it works
unseen, yet certainly, we suppose to be an instinct, implanted in the
mind; as we sometimes attribute the violent operations of our
passions, of which we can neither trace the source nor assign the
reason, to the instigation of the Devil!</p>

<p class='c013'>I shall here try to go more at large into this subject, and to give
such instances and illustrations of it as occur to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the persons who had rendered themselves obnoxious to
Government, and been included in a charge for high treason in the
year 1794, had retired soon after into Wales to write an epic poem
and enjoy the luxuries of a rural life. In his peregrinations through
that beautiful scenery, he had arrived one fine morning at the inn at
Llangollen, in the romantic valley of that name. He had ordered
his breakfast, and was sitting at the window in all the dalliance of
expectation, when a face passed of which he took no notice at the
instant—but when his breakfast was brought in presently after, he
found his appetite for it gone, the day had lost its freshness in his
eye, he was uneasy and spiritless; and without any cause that he
could discover, a total change had taken place in his feelings.
While he was trying to account for this odd circumstance, the same
face passed again—it was the face of Taylor the spy; and he was
no longer at a loss to explain the difficulty. He had before caught
only a transient glimpse, a passing side-view of the face; but though
this was not sufficient to awaken a distinct idea in his memory, his
feelings, quicker and surer, had taken the alarm; a string had been
touched that gave a jar to his whole frame, and would not let him
rest, though he could not at all tell what was the matter with him.
To the flitting, shadowy, half-distinguished profile that had glided
by his window was linked unconsciously and mysteriously, but
inseparably, the impression of the trains that had been laid for him
by this person;—in this brief moment, in this dim, illegible short-hand
of the mind he had just escaped the speeches of the Attorney
and Solicitor-General over again; the gaunt figure of Mr. Pitt
glared by him; the walls of a prison enclosed him; and he felt the
hands of the executioner near him, without knowing it till the tremor
and disorder of his nerves gave information to his reasoning faculties
that all was not well within. That is, the same state of mind was
recalled by one circumstance in the series of association that had
been produced by the whole set of circumstances at the time, though
the manner in which this was done was not immediately perceptible.
In other words, the feeling of pleasure or pain, of good or evil, is
revived, and acts instantaneously upon the mind, before we have time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>to recollect the precise objects which have originally given birth to
it.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The incident here mentioned was merely, then, one case of
what the learned understand by the <em>association of ideas</em>: but all that
is meant by feeling or common sense is nothing but the different
cases of the association of ideas, more or less true to the impression
of the original circumstances, as reason begins with the more formal
developement of those circumstances, or pretends to account for the
different cases of the association of ideas. But it does not follow
that the dumb and silent pleading of the former (though sometimes,
nay often mistaken) is less true than that of its babbling interpreter,
or that we are never to trust its dictates without consulting the
express authority of reason. Both are imperfect, both are useful in
their way, and therefore both are best together, to correct or to
confirm one another. It does not appear that in the singular instance
above mentioned, the sudden impression on the mind was superstition
or fancy, though it might have been thought so, had it not been
proved by the event to have a real physical and moral cause. Had
not the same face returned again, the doubt would never have been
properly cleared up, but would have remained a puzzle ever after,
or perhaps have been soon forgot.—By the law of association, as
laid down by physiologists, any impression in a series can recal any
other impression in that series without going through the whole in
order: so that the mind drops the intermediate links, and passes on
rapidly and by stealth to the more striking effects of pleasure or pain
which have naturally taken the strongest hold of it. By doing this
habitually and skilfully with respect to the various impressions and
circumstances with which our experience makes us acquainted, it
forms a series of unpremeditated conclusions on almost all subjects
that can be brought before it, as just as they are of ready application
to human life; and common sense is the name of this body of
unassuming but practical wisdom. Common sense, however, is an
impartial, instinctive result of truth and nature, and will therefore
bear the test and abide the scrutiny of the most severe and patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>reasoning. It is indeed incomplete without it. By ingrafting reason
on feeling, we ‘make assurance double sure.’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘’Tis the last key-stone that makes up the arch—</div>
      <div class='line'>Then stands it a triumphal mark! Then men</div>
      <div class='line'>Observe the strength, the height, the why and when</div>
      <div class='line'>It was erected: and still walking under,</div>
      <div class='line'>Meet some new matter to look up, and wonder.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>But reason, not employed to interpret nature, and to improve and
perfect common sense and experience, is, for the most part, a
building without a foundation.—The criticism exercised by reason
then on common sense may be as severe as it pleases, but it must be
as patient as it is severe. Hasty, dogmatical, self-satisfied reason is
worse than idle fancy, or bigotted prejudice. It is systematic,
ostentatious in error, closes up the avenues of knowledge, and ‘shuts
the gates of wisdom on mankind.’ It is not enough to shew that
there is no reason for a thing, that we do not see the reason of it:
if the common feeling, if the involuntary prejudice sets in strong
in favour of it, if, in spite of all we can do, there is a lurking
suspicion on the side of our first impressions, we must try again, and
believe that truth is mightier than we. So, in offering a definition
of any subject, if we feel a misgiving that there is any fact or circumstance
omitted, but of which we have only a vague apprehension, like
a name we cannot recollect, we must ask for more time, and not
cut the matter short by an arrogant assumption of the point in
dispute. Common sense thus acts as a check-weight on sophistry,
and suspends our rash and superficial judgments. On the other hand,
if not only no reason can be given for a thing, but every reason is
clear against it, and we can account from ignorance, from authority,
from interest, from different causes, for the prevalence of an opinion
or sentiment, then we have a right to conclude that we have mistaken
a prejudice for an instinct, or have confounded a false and partial
impression with the fair and unavoidable inference from general
observation. Mr. Burke said that we ought not to reject every
prejudice, but should separate the husk of prejudice from the truth
it encloses, and so try to get at the kernel within; and thus far he
was right. But he was wrong in insisting that we are to cherish our
prejudices, ‘because they are prejudices:’ for if they are all well-founded,
there is no occasion to inquire into their origin or use; and he
who sets out to philosophise upon them, or make the separation Mr.
Burke talks of in this spirit and with this previous determination, will
be very likely to mistake a maggot or a rotten canker for the precious
kernel of truth, as was indeed the case with our political sophist.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>There is nothing more distinct than common sense and vulgar
opinion. Common sense is only a judge of things that fall under
common observation, or immediately come home to the business and
bosoms of men. This is of the very essence of its principle, the
basis of its pretensions. It rests upon the simple process of feeling,
it anchors in experience. It is not, nor it cannot be, the test of
abstract, speculative opinions. But half the opinions and prejudices
of mankind, those which they hold in the most unqualified approbation
and which have been instilled into them under the strongest
sanctions, are of this latter kind, that is, opinions, not which they
have ever thought, known, or felt one tittle about, but which they
have taken up on trust from others, which have been palmed on their
understandings by fraud or force, and which they continue to hold
at the peril of life, limb, property, and character, with as little
warrant from common sense in the first instance as appeal to reason
in the last. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima ratio regum</span></i> proceeds upon a very different
plea. Common sense is neither priestcraft nor state-policy. Yet
‘there’s the rub that makes absurdity of so long life;’ and, at the
same time, gives the sceptical philosophers the advantage over us.
Till nature has fair play allowed it, and is not adulterated by political
and polemical quacks (as it so often has been), it is impossible to
appeal to it as a defence against the errors and extravagances of mere
reason. If we talk of common sense, we are twitted with vulgar
prejudice, and asked how we distinguish the one from the other: but
common and received opinion is indeed ‘a compost heap’ of crude
notions, got together by the pride and passions of individuals, and
reason is itself the thrall or manumitted slave of the same lordly and
besotted masters, dragging its servile chain, or committing all sorts of
Saturnalian licences, the moment it feels itself freed from it.—If ten
millions of Englishmen are furious in thinking themselves right in
making war upon thirty millions of Frenchmen, and if the last are
equally bent upon thinking the others always in the wrong, though it
is a common and national prejudice, both opinions cannot be the
dictate of good sense: but it may be the infatuated policy of one or
both governments to keep their subjects always at variance. If a
few centuries ago all Europe believed in the infallibility of the Pope,
this was not an opinion derived from the proper exercise or erroneous
direction of the common sense of the people: common sense had
nothing to do with it—they believed whatever their priests told them.
England at present is divided into Whigs and Tories, Churchmen
and Dissenters: both parties have numbers on their side; but
common sense and party-spirit are two different things. Sects and
heresies are upheld partly by sympathy, and partly by the love of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>contradiction: if there was nobody of a different way of thinking,
they would fall to pieces of themselves. If a whole court say the
same thing, this is no proof that they think it, but that the individual
at the head of the court has said it: if a mob agree for a while in
shouting the same watch-word, this is not to me an example of the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sensus communis</span></i>; they only repeat what they have heard repeated by
others. If indeed a large proportion of the people are in want of
food, of clothing, of shelter, if they are sick, miserable, scorned,
oppressed, and if each feeling it in himself, they all say so with one
voice and one heart, and lift up their hands to second their appeal,
this I should say was but the dictate of common sense, the cry of
nature. But to wave this part of the argument, which it is needless
to push farther, I believe that the best way to instruct mankind is not
by pointing out to them their mutual errors, but by teaching them to
think rightly on indifferent matters, where they will listen with
patience in order to be amused, and where they do not consider a
definition or a syllogism as the greatest injury you can offer them.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no rule for expression. It is got at solely by <em>feeling</em>, that
is, on the principle of the association of ideas, and by transferring
what has been found to hold good in one case (with the necessary
modifications) to others. A certain look has been remarked strongly
indicative of a certain passion or trait of character, and we attach the
same meaning to it or are affected in the same pleasurable or painful
manner by it, where it exists in a less degree, though we can define
neither the look itself nor the modification of it. Having got the
general clue, the exact result may be left to the imagination to vary,
to extenuate or aggravate it according to circumstances. In the
admirable profile of Oliver Cromwell after —, the drooping eye-lids,
as if drawing a veil over the fixed, penetrating glance, the
nostrils somewhat distended, and lips compressed so as hardly to let
the breath escape him, denote the character of the man for high-reaching
policy and deep designs as plainly as they can be written.
How is it that we decipher this expression in the face? First, by
feeling it: and how is it that we feel it? Not by pre-established
rules, but by the instinct of analogy, by the principle of association,
which is subtle and sure in proportion as it is variable and indefinite.
A circumstance, apparently of no value, shall alter the whole interpretation
to be put upon an expression or action; and it shall alter it
thus powerfully because in proportion to its very insignificance it
shews a strong general principle at work that extends in its ramifications
to the smallest things. This in fact will make all the difference
between minuteness and subtlety or refinement; for a small or trivial
effect may in given circumstances imply the operation of a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>power. Stillness may be the result of a blow too powerful to be
resisted; silence may be imposed by feelings too agonising for utterance.
The minute, the trifling and insipid, is that which is little in
itself, in its causes and its consequences: the subtle and refined is
that which is slight and evanescent at first sight, but which mounts
up to a mighty sum in the end, which is an essential part of an
important whole, which has consequences greater than itself, and
where more is meant than meets the eye or ear. We complain
sometimes of littleness in a Dutch picture, where there are a vast
number of distinct parts and objects, each small in itself, and leading
to nothing else. A sky of Claude’s cannot fall under this censure,
where one imperceptible gradation is as it were the scale to another,
where the broad arch of heaven is piled up of endlessly intermediate
gold and azure tints, and where an infinite number of minute, scarce
noticed particulars blend and melt into universal harmony. The
subtlety in Shakespear, of which there is an immense deal every
where scattered up and down, is always the instrument of passion,
the vehicle of character. The action of a man pulling his hat over
his forehead is indifferent enough in itself, and, generally speaking,
may mean any thing or nothing: but in the circumstances in which
Macduff is placed, it is neither insignificant nor equivocal.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c015'>It admits but of one interpretation or inference, that which follows
it:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The passage in the same play, in which Duncan and his attendants
are introduced commenting on the beauty and situation of Macbeth’s
castle, though familiar in itself, has been often praised for the striking
contrast it presents to the scenes which follow.—The same look
in different circumstances may convey a totally different expression.
Thus the eye turned round to look at you without turning the head
indicates generally slyness or suspicion: but if this is combined with
large expanded eye-lids or fixed eyebrows, as we see it in Titian’s
pictures, it will denote calm contemplation or piercing sagacity, without
any thing of meanness or fear of being observed. In other cases,
it may imply merely indolent enticing voluptuousness, as in Lely’s
portraits of women. The languor and weakness of the eye-lids gives
the amorous turn to the expression. How should there be a rule for
all this beforehand, seeing it depends on circumstances ever varying,
and scarce discernible but by their effect on the mind? Rules are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>applicable to abstractions, but expression is concrete and individual.
We know the meaning of certain looks, and we feel how they
modify one another in conjunction. But we cannot have a separate
rule to judge of all their combinations in different degrees and circumstances,
without foreseeing all those combinations, which is
impossible: or, if we did foresee them, we should only be where we
are, that is, we could only make the rule as we now judge without it,
from imagination and the feeling of the moment. The absurdity of
reducing expression to a preconcerted system was perhaps never
more evidently shewn than in a picture of the Judgment of Solomon
by so great a man as N. Poussin, which I once heard admired for
the skill and discrimination of the artist in making all the women,
who are ranged on one side, in the greatest alarm at the sentence of
the judge, while all the men on the opposite side see through the
design of it. Nature does not go to work or cast things in a regular
mould in this sort of way. I once heard a person remark of another—‘He
has an eye like a vicious horse.’ This was a fair analogy.
We all, I believe, have noticed the look of a horse’s eye, just before
he is going to bite or kick. But will any one, therefore, describe to
me exactly what that look is? It was the same acute observer that
said of a self-sufficient prating music-master—‘He talks on all subjects
at <em>sight</em>’—which expressed the man at once by an allusion to
his profession. The coincidence was indeed perfect. Nothing else
could compare to the easy assurance with which this gentleman
would volunteer an explanation of things of which he was most
ignorant; but the <em>nonchalance</em> with which a musician sits down to a
harpsichord to play a piece he has never seen before. My physiognomical
friend would not have hit on this mode of illustration without
knowing the profession of the subject of his criticism; but having
this hint given him, it instantly suggested itself to his ‘sure trailing.’
The manner of the speaker was evident; and the association of the
music-master sitting down to play at sight, lurking in his mind, was
immediately called out by the strength of his impression of the
character. The feeling of character, and the felicity of invention in
explaining it, were nearly allied to each other. The first was so
wrought up and running over, that the transition to the last was easy
and unavoidable. When Mr. Kean was so much praised for the
action of Richard in his last struggle with his triumphant antagonist,
where he stands, after his sword is wrested from him, with his hands
stretched out, ‘as if his will could not be disarmed, and the very
phantoms of his despair had a withering power,’ he said that he
borrowed it from seeing the last efforts of Painter in his fight with
Oliver. This assuredly did not lessen the merit of it. Thus it ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>is with the man of real genius. He has the feeling of truth already
shrined in his own breast, and his eye is still bent on nature to see
how she expresses herself. When we thoroughly understand the
subject, it is easy to translate from one language into another.
Raphael, in muffling up the figure of Elymas the Sorcerer in his
garments, appears to have extended the idea of blindness even to his
clothes. Was this design? Probably not; but merely the feeling
of analogy thoughtlessly suggesting this device, which being so
suggested was retained and carried on, because it flattered or fell in
with the original feeling. The tide of passion, when strong, overflows
and gradually insinuates itself into all nooks and corners of the
mind. Invention (of the best kind) I therefore do not think so
distinct a thing from feeling, as some are apt to imagine. The
springs of pure feeling will rise and fill the moulds of fancy that are
fit to receive it. There are some striking coincidences of colour in
well-composed pictures, as in a straggling weed in the foreground
streaked with blue or red to answer to a blue or red drapery, to the
tone of the flesh or an opening in the sky:—not that this was
intended, or done by rule (for then it would presently become
affected and ridiculous), but the eye being imbued with a certain
colour, repeats and varies it from a natural sense of harmony, a secret
craving and appetite for beauty, which in the same manner soothes
and gratifies the eye of taste, though the cause is not understood.
<em>Tact</em>, <em>finesse</em>, is nothing but the being completely aware of the feeling
belonging to certain situations, passions, &amp;c. and the being consequently
sensible to their slightest indications or movements in others.
One of the most remarkable instances of this sort of faculty is the
following story, told of Lord Shaftesbury, the grandfather of the
author of the Characteristics. He had been to dine with Lady
Clarendon and her daughter, who was at that time privately married
to the Duke of York (afterwards James <span class='fss'>II.</span>) and as he returned home
with another nobleman who had accompanied him, he suddenly
turned to him, and said, ‘Depend upon it, the Duke has married
Hyde’s daughter.’ His companion could not comprehend what he
meant; but on explaining himself, he said, ‘Her mother behaved to
her with an attention and a marked respect that it is impossible
to account for in any other way; and I am sure of it.’ His conjecture
shortly afterwards proved to be the truth. This was carrying
the prophetic spirit of common sense as far as it could go.—</p>

  <h3 class='c008'>ESSAY V<br /> <span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Genius or originality is, for the most part, <em>some strong quality in the
mind, answering to and bringing out some new and striking quality in
nature</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Imagination is, more properly, the power of carrying on a given
feeling into other situations, which must be done best according to
the hold which the feeling itself has taken of the mind.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> In new
and unknown combinations, the impression must act by sympathy,
and not by rule; but there can be no sympathy, where there is no
passion, no original interest. The personal interest may in some
cases oppress and circumscribe the imaginative faculty, as in the
instance of Rousseau: but in general the strength and consistency of
the imagination will be in proportion to the strength and depth of
feeling; and it is rarely that a man even of lofty genius will be able
to do more than carry on his own feelings and character, or some
prominent and ruling passion, into fictitious and uncommon situations.
Milton has by allusion embodied a great part of his political and
personal history in the chief characters and incidents of Paradise
Lost. He has, no doubt, wonderfully adapted and heightened them,
but the elements are the same; you trace the bias and opinions of
the man in the creations of the poet. Shakespear (almost alone)
seems to have been a man of genius, raised above the definition of
genius. ‘Born universal heir to all humanity,’ he was ‘as one, in
suffering all who suffered nothing;’ with a perfect sympathy with
all things, yet alike indifferent to all: who did not tamper with
nature or warp her to his own purposes; who ‘knew all qualities
with a learned spirit,’ instead of judging of them by his own predilections;
and was rather ‘a pipe for the Muse’s finger to play what
stop she pleased,’ than anxious to set up any character or pretensions
of his own. His genius consisted in the faculty of transforming
himself at will into whatever he chose: his originality was the power
of seeing every object from the exact point of view in which others
would see it. He was the Proteus of human intellect. Genius in
ordinary is a more obstinate and less versatile thing. It is sufficiently
exclusive and self-willed, quaint and peculiar. It does some one
thing by virtue of doing nothing else: it excels in some one pursuit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>by being blind to all excellence but its own. It is just the reverse of
the cameleon; for it does not borrow, but lend its colour to all
about it: or like the glow-worm, discloses a little circle of gorgeous
light in the twilight of obscurity, in the night of intellect, that surrounds
it. So did Rembrandt. If ever there was a man of genius,
he was one, in the proper sense of the term. He lived in and
revealed to others a world of his own, and might be said to have
invented a new view of nature. He did not discover things <em>out of</em>
nature, in fiction or fairy land, or make a voyage to the moon ‘to
descry new lands, rivers, or mountains in her spotty globe,’ but saw
things <em>in</em> nature that every one had missed before him, and gave
others eyes to see them with. This is the test and triumph of
originality, not to shew us what has never been, and what we may
therefore very easily never have dreamt of, but to point out to us
what is before our eyes and under our feet, though we have had no
suspicion of its existence, for want of sufficient strength of intuition,
of determined grasp of mind to seize and retain it. Rembrandt’s
conquests were not over the <em>ideal</em>, but the real. He did not contrive
a new story or character, but we nearly owe to him a fifth part of
painting, the knowledge of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaroscuro</span></i>—a distinct power and element
in art and nature. He had a steadiness, a firm keeping of mind and
eye, that first stood the shock of ‘fierce extremes’ in light and
shade, or reconciled the greatest obscurity and the greatest brilliancy
into perfect harmony; and he therefore was the first to hazard this
appearance upon canvas, and give full effect to what he saw and
delighted in. He was led to adopt this style of broad and startling
contrast from its congeniality to his own feelings: his mind grappled
with that which afforded the best exercise to its master-powers: he
was bold in act, because he was urged on by a strong native impulse.
Originality is then nothing but nature and feeling working in the
mind. A man does not affect to be original: he is so, because he
cannot help it, and often without knowing it. This extraordinary
artist indeed might be said to have had a particular organ for colour.
His eye seemed to come in contact with it as a feeling, to lay hold
of it as a substance, rather than to contemplate it as a visual object.
The texture of his landscapes is ‘of the earth, earthy’—his clouds
are humid, heavy, slow; his shadows are ‘darkness that may be felt,’
a ‘palpable obscure;’ his lights are lumps of liquid splendour!
There is something more in this than can be accounted for from
design or accident: Rembrandt was not a man made up of two or
three rules and directions for acquiring genius.</p>

<p class='c013'>I am afraid I shall hardly write so satisfactory a character of Mr.
Wordsworth, though he, too, like Rembrandt, has a faculty of making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>something out of nothing, that is, out of himself, by the medium
through which he sees and with which he clothes the barrenest
subject. Mr. Wordsworth is the last man to ‘look abroad into
universality,’ if that alone constituted genius: he looks at home into
himself, and is ‘content with riches fineless.’ He would in the
other case be ‘poor as winter,’ if he had nothing but general capacity
to trust to. He is the greatest, that is, the most original poet of the
present day, only because he is the greatest egotist. He is ‘self-involved,
not dark.’ He sits in the centre of his own being, and
there ‘enjoys bright day.’ He does not waste a thought on others.
Whatever does not relate exclusively and wholly to himself, is foreign
to his views. He contemplates a whole-length figure of himself, he
looks along the unbroken line of his personal identity. He thrusts
aside all other objects, all other interests with scorn and impatience,
that he may repose on his own being, that he may dig out the
treasures of thought contained in it, that he may unfold the precious
stores of a mind for ever brooding over itself. His genius is the
effect of his individual character. He stamps that character, that
deep individual interest, on whatever he meets. The object is
nothing but as it furnishes food for internal meditation, for old
associations. If there had been no other being in the universe, Mr.
Wordsworth’s poetry would have been just what it is. If there had
been neither love nor friendship, neither ambition nor pleasure nor
business in the world, the author of the Lyrical Ballads need not
have been greatly changed from what he is—might still have ‘kept
the noiseless tenour of his way,’ retired in the sanctuary of his own
heart, hallowing the Sabbath of his own thoughts. With the passions,
the pursuits, and imaginations of other men, he does not profess to
sympathise, but ‘finds tongues in the trees, books in the running
brooks, sermons in stones, and good in every thing.’ With a mind
averse from outward objects, but ever intent upon its own workings,
he hangs a weight of thought and feeling upon every trifling circumstance
connected with his past history. The note of the cuckoo
sounds in his ear like the voice of other years; the daisy spreads its
leaves in the rays of boyish delight, that stream from his thoughtful
eyes; the rainbow lifts its proud arch in heaven but to mark his
progress from infancy to manhood; an old thorn is buried, bowed
down under the mass of associations he has wound about it; and to
him, as he himself beautifully says,</p>

<p class='c015'>It is this power of habitual sentiment, or of transferring the interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>of our conscious existence to whatever gently solicits attention, and
is a link in the chain of association, without rousing our passions or
hurting our pride, that is the striking feature in Mr. Wordsworth’s
mind and poetry. Others have felt and shown this power before, as
Withers, Burns, &amp;c. but none have felt it so intensely and absolutely
as to lend to it the voice of inspiration, as to make it the foundation
of a new style and school in poetry. His strength, as it so often
happens, arises from the excess of his weakness. But he has opened
a new avenue to the human heart, has explored another secret haunt
and nook of nature, ‘sacred to verse, and sure of everlasting fame.’
Compared with his lines, Lord Byron’s stanzas are but exaggerated
common-place, and Walter Scott’s poetry (not his prose) old wives’
fables.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> There is no one in whom I have been more disappointed
than in the writer here spoken of, nor with whom I am more disposed
on certain points to quarrel: but the love of truth and justice which
obliges me to do this, will not suffer me to blench his merits. Do
what he can, he cannot help being an original-minded man. His
poetry is not servile. While the cuckoo returns in the spring, while
the daisy looks bright in the sun, while the rainbow lifts its head
above the storm—</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir Joshua Reynolds, in endeavouring to show that there is no such
thing as proper originality, a spirit emanating from the mind of the
artist and shining through his works, has traced Raphael through a
number of figures which he has borrowed from Masaccio and others.
This is a bad calculation. If Raphael had only borrowed those
figures from others, would he, even in Sir Joshua’s sense, have been
entitled to the praise of originality? Plagiarism, I presume, in so
far as it is plagiarism, is not originality. Salvator is considered by
many as a great genius. He was what they call an irregular genius.
My notion of genius is not exactly the same as theirs. It has also
been made a question whether there is not more genius in Rembrandt’s
<cite>Three Trees</cite> than in all Claude Lorraine’s landscapes? I do not
know how that may be: but it was enough for Claude to have been a
perfect landscape-painter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Capacity is not the same thing as genius. Capacity may be described
to relate to the quantity of knowledge, however acquired;
genius to its quality and the mode of acquiring it. Capacity is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>power over given ideas or combinations of ideas; genius is the power
over those which are not given, and for which no obvious or precise
rule can be laid down. Or capacity is power of any sort: genius is
power of a different sort from what has yet been shown. A retentive
memory, a clear understanding is capacity, but it is not genius. The
admirable Crichton was a person of prodigious capacity; but there is
no proof (that I know) that he had an atom of genius. His verses
that remain are dull and sterile. He could learn all that was known
of any subject: he could do any thing if others could show him the
way to do it. This was very wonderful: but that is all you can say
of it. It requires a good capacity to play well at chess: but, after
all, it is a game of skill, and not of genius. Know what you will of
it, the understanding still moves in certain tracks in which others
have trod before it, quicker or slower, with more or less comprehension
and presence of mind. The greatest skill strikes out nothing
for itself, from its own peculiar resources; the nature of the game is
a thing determinate and fixed: there is no royal or poetical road to
check-mate your adversary. There is no place for genius but in the
indefinite and unknown. The discovery of the binomial theorem
was an effort of genius; but there was none shown in Jedediah
Buxton’s being able to multiply 9 figures by 9 in his head. If he
could have multiplied 90 figures by 90 instead of 9, it would have
been equally useless toil and trouble.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> He is a man of capacity who
possesses considerable intellectual riches: he is a man of genius who
finds out a vein of new ore. Originality is the seeing nature differently
from others, and yet as it is in itself. It is not singularity or
affectation, but the discovery of new and valuable truth. All the
world do not see the whole meaning of any object they have been
looking at. Habit blinds them to some things: short-sightedness to
others. Every mind is not a gauge and measure of truth. Nature
has her surface and her dark recesses. She is deep, obscure, and
infinite. It is only minds on whom she makes her fullest impressions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>that can penetrate her shrine or unveil her <em>Holy of Holies</em>. It is only
those whom she has filled with her spirit that have the boldness or
the power to reveal her mysteries to others. But nature has a
thousand aspects, and one man can only draw out one of them.
Whoever does this, is a man of genius. One displays her force,
another her refinement, one her power of harmony, another her
suddenness of contrast, one her beauty of form, another her splendour
of colour. Each does that for which he is best fitted by his particular
genius, that is to say, by some quality of mind in which the
quality of the object sinks deepest, where it finds the most cordial
welcome, is perceived to its utmost extent, and where again it forces
its way out from the fulness with which it has taken possession of the
mind of the student. The imagination gives out what it has first
absorbed by congeniality of temperament, what it has attracted and
moulded into itself by elective affinity, as the loadstone draws and
impregnates iron. A little originality is more esteemed and sought
for than the greatest acquired talent, because it throws a new light
upon things, and is peculiar to the individual. The other is common;
and may be had for the asking, to any amount.</p>

<p class='c013'>The value of any work is to be judged of by the quantity of
originality contained in it. A very little of this will go a great
way. If Goldsmith had never written any thing but the two or
three first chapters of the Vicar of Wakefield, or the character
of a Village-Schoolmaster, they would have stamped him a man of
genius. The Editors of Encyclopedias are not usually reckoned the
first literary characters of the age. The works, of which they have
the management, contain a great deal of knowledge, like chests or
warehouses, but the goods are not their own. We should as soon
think of admiring the shelves of a library; but the shelves of a library
are useful and respectable. I was once applied to, in a delicate
emergency, to write an article on a difficult subject for an Encyclopedia,
and was advised to take time and give it a systematic and
scientific form, to avail myself of all the knowledge that was to be
obtained on the subject, and arrange it with clearness and method.
I made answer that as to the first, I had taken time to do all that I
ever pretended to do, as I had thought incessantly on different matters
for twenty years of my life;<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> that I had no particular knowledge of
the subject in question, and no head for arrangement; and that the
utmost I could do in such a case would be, when a systematic and
scientific article was prepared, to write marginal notes upon it, to
insert a remark or illustration of my own (not to be found in former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Encyclopedias) or to suggest a better definition than had been offered
in the text. There are two sorts of writing. The first is compilation;
and consists in collecting and stating all that is already
known of any question in the best possible manner, for the benefit
of the uninformed reader. An author of this class is a very learned
amanuensis of other people’s thoughts. The second sort proceeds on
an entirely different principle. Instead of bringing down the account
of knowledge to the point at which it has already arrived, it professes
to start from that point on the strength of the writer’s individual
reflections; and supposing the reader in possession of what is already
known, supplies deficiencies, fills up certain blanks, and quits the
beaten road in search of new tracts of observation or sources of feeling.
It is in vain to object to this last style that it is disjointed,
disproportioned, and irregular. It is merely a set of additions and
corrections to other men’s works, or to the common stock of human
knowledge, printed separately. You might as well expect a continued
chain of reasoning in the notes to a book. It skips all the
trite, intermediate, level common-places of the subject, and only stops
at the difficult passages of the human mind, or touches on some
striking point that has been overlooked in previous editions. A view
of a subject, to be connected and regular, cannot be all new. A
writer will always be liable to be charged either with paradox or
common-place, either with dulness or affectation. But we have no
right to demand from any one more than he pretends to. There is
indeed a medium in all things, but to unite opposite excellencies, is a
task ordinarily too hard for mortality. He who succeeds in what he
aims at, or who takes the lead in any one mode or path of excellence,
may think himself very well off. It would not be fair to complain
of the style of an Encyclopedia as dull, as wanting volatile salt; nor
of the style of an Essay because it is too light and sparkling, because
it is not a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i>. So it is rather an odd objection to a work
that is made up entirely of ‘brilliant passages’—at least it is a fault
that can be found with few works, and the book might be pardoned
for its singularity. The censure might indeed seem like adroit flattery,
if it were not passed on an author whom any objection is sufficient to
render unpopular and ridiculous. I grant it is best to unite solidity
with show, general information with particular ingenuity. This is
the pattern of a perfect style: but I myself do not pretend to be a
perfect writer. In fine, we do not banish light French wines from
our tables, or refuse to taste sparkling Champagne when we can get
it, because it has not the body of Old Port. Besides, I do not know
that dulness is strength, or that an observation is slight, because it is
striking. Mediocrity, insipidity, want of character is the great fault.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mediocribus esse poetis non Dii, non homines, non concessêre columnæ.</span></i>
Neither is this privilege allowed to prose-writers in our time, any
more than to poets formerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not then acuteness of organs or extent of capacity that constitutes
rare genius or produces the most exquisite models of art,
but an intense sympathy with some one beauty or distinguishing
characteristic in nature. Irritability alone, or the interest taken in
certain things, may supply the place of genius in weak and otherwise
ordinary minds. As there are certain instruments fitted to perform
certain kinds of labour, there are certain minds so framed as to produce
certain <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></i> in art and literature, which is surely the
best use they can be put to. If a man had all sorts of instruments
in his shop and wanted one, he would rather have that one than be
supplied with a double set of all the others. If he had them all
twice over, he could only do what he can do as it is, whereas without
that one he perhaps cannot finish any one work he has in hand. So
if a man can do one thing better than any body else, the value of this
one thing is what he must stand or fall by, and his being able to do a
hundred other things merely <em>as well</em> as any body else, would not alter
the sentence or add to his respectability; on the contrary, his being
able to do so many other things well would probably interfere with
and incumber him in the execution of the only thing that others
cannot do as well as he, and so far be a drawback and a disadvantage.
More people in fact fail from a multiplicity of talents and pretensions
than from an absolute poverty of resources. I have given instances
of this elsewhere. Perhaps Shakespear’s tragedies would in some
respects have been better, if he had never written comedies at all;
and in that case, his comedies might well have been spared, though
they might have cost us some regret. Racine, it is said, might have
rivalled Moliere in comedy; but he gave up the cultivation of his comic
talents to devote himself wholly to the tragic Muse. If, as the French
tell us, he in consequence attained to the perfection of tragic composition,
this was better than writing comedies as well as Moliere and
tragedies as well as Crebillon. Yet I count those persons fools who
think it a pity Hogarth did not succeed better in serious subjects.
The division of labour is an excellent principle in taste as well as in
mechanics. Without this, I find from Adam Smith, we could not
have a pin made to the degree of perfection it is. We do not, on
any rational scheme of criticism, inquire into the variety of a man’s
excellences, or the number of his works, or his facility of production.
Venice Preserved is sufficient for Otway’s fame. I hate all those
nonsensical stories about Lopez de Vega and his writing a play in
a morning before breakfast. He had time enough to do it after. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>a man leaves behind him any work which is a model in its kind, we
have no right to ask whether he could do any thing else, or how he
did it, or how long he was about it. All that talent which is not
necessary to the actual quantity of excellence existing in the world,
loses its object, is so much waste talent or <em>talent to let</em>. I heard a
sensible man say he should like to do some one thing better than all
the rest of the world, and in every thing else to be like all the rest of
the world. Why should a man do more than his part? The rest is
vanity and vexation of spirit. We look with jealous and grudging
eyes at all those qualifications which are not essential; first, because
they are superfluous, and next, because we suspect they will be prejudicial.
Why does Mr. Kean play all those harlequin tricks of
singing, dancing, fencing, &amp;c.? They say, ‘It is for his benefit.’
It is not for his reputation. Garrick indeed shone equally in comedy
and tragedy. But he was first, not second-rate in both. There is
not a greater impertinence than to ask, if a man is clever out of his
profession. I have heard of people trying to cross-examine Mrs.
Siddons. I would as soon try to entrap one of the Elgin Marbles
into an argument. Good nature and common sense are required
from all people: but one proud distinction is enough for any one
individual to possess or to aspire to!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY VI<br /> <span class='small'>CHARACTER OF COBBETT</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>People have about as substantial an idea of Cobbett as they have of
Cribb. His blows are as hard, and he himself is as impenetrable.
One has no notion of him as making use of a fine pen, but a great
mutton-fist; his style stuns his readers, and he ‘fillips the ear of the
public with a three-man beetle.’ He is too much for any single
newspaper antagonist; ‘lays waste’ a city orator or Member of
Parliament, and bears hard upon the government itself. He is a
kind of <em>fourth estate</em> in the politics of the country. He is not only
unquestionably the most powerful political writer of the present day,
but one of the best writers in the language. He speaks and thinks
plain, broad, downright English. He might be said to have the
clearness of Swift, the naturalness of Defoe, and the picturesque
satirical description of Mandeville; if all such comparisons were not
impertinent. A really great and original writer is like nobody but
himself. In one sense, Sterne was not a wit, nor Shakespear a poet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>It is easy to describe second-rate talents, because they fall into a class,
and enlist under a standard: but first-rate powers defy calculation or
comparison, and can be defined only by themselves. They are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui
generis</span></i>, and make the class to which they belong. I have tried half
a dozen times to describe Burke’s style without ever succeeding;—its
severe extravagance; its literal boldness; its matter-of-fact hyperboles;
its running away with a subject, and from it at the same time—but
there is no making it out, for there is no example of the same
thing any where else. We have no common measure to refer to;
and his qualities contradict even themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cobbett is not so difficult. He has been compared to Paine; and
so far it is true there are no two writers who come more into juxtaposition
from the nature of their subjects, from the internal resources
on which they draw, and from the popular effect of their writings,
and their adaptation (though that is a bad word in the present case)
to the capacity of every reader. But still if we turn to a volume of
Paine’s (his Common Sense or Rights of Man), we are struck (not
to say somewhat refreshed) by the difference. Paine is a much
more sententious writer than Cobbett. You cannot open a page in
any of his best and earlier works without meeting with some maxim,
some antithetical and memorable saying, which is a sort of starting-place
for the argument, and the goal to which it returns. There is
not a single <em>bon-mot</em>, a single sentence in Cobbett that has ever been
quoted again. If any thing is ever quoted from him, it is an epithet
of abuse or a nickname. He is an excellent hand at invention in
that way, and has ‘damnable iteration in him.’ What could be
better than his pestering Erskine year after year with his second title
of Baron Clackmannan? He is rather too fond of <cite>the Sons and
Daughters of Corruption</cite>. Paine affected to reduce things to first
principles, to announce self-evident truths. Cobbett troubles himself
about little but the details and local circumstances. The first
appeared to have made up his mind beforehand to certain opinions,
and to try to find the most compendious and pointed expressions for
them: his successor appears to have no clue, no fixed or leading
principles, nor ever to have thought on a question till he sits down
to write about it; but then there seems no end of his matters of fact
and raw materials, which are brought out in all their strength and
sharpness from not having been squared or frittered down or vamped
up to suit a theory—he goes on with his descriptions and illustrations
as if he would never come to a stop; they have all the force of
novelty with all the familiarity of old acquaintance; his knowledge
grows out of the subject, and his style is that of a man who has an
absolute intuition of what he is talking about, and never thinks of any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>thing else. He deals in premises and speaks to evidence—the coming
to a conclusion and summing up (which was Paine’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i>) lies in a
smaller compass. The one could not compose an elementary treatise
on politics to become a manual for the popular reader; nor could the
other in all probability have kept up a weekly journal for the same
number of years with the same spirit, interest, and untired perseverance.
Paine’s writings are a sort of introduction to political
arithmetic on a new plan: Cobbett keeps a day-book and makes an
entry at full of all the occurrences and troublesome questions that
start up throughout the year. Cobbett, with vast industry, vast
information, and the utmost power of making what he says intelligible,
never seems to get at the beginning or come to the end of any
question: Paine, in a few short sentences, seems by his peremptory
manner ‘to clear it from all controversy, past, present, and to come.’
Paine takes a bird’s-eye view of things. Cobbett sticks close to
them, inspects the component parts, and keeps fast hold of the smallest
advantages they afford him. Or, if I might here be indulged in a
pastoral allusion, Paine tries to enclose his ideas in a fold for security
and repose: Cobbett lets <em>his</em> pour out upon the plain like a flock of
sheep to feed and batten. Cobbett is a pleasanter writer for those to
read who do not agree with him; for he is less dogmatical, goes
more into the common grounds of fact and argument to which all
appeal, is more desultory and various, and appears less to be driving
at a previous conclusion than urged on by the force of present conviction.
He is therefore tolerated by all parties, though he has made
himself by turns obnoxious to all; and even those he abuses read him.
The Reformers read him when he was a Tory, and the Tories read
him now that he is a Reformer. He must, I think, however, be
<em>caviare</em> to the Whigs.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>If he is less metaphysical and poetical than his celebrated prototype,
he is more picturesque and dramatic. His episodes, which are
numerous as they are pertinent, are striking, interesting, full of life
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>, minute, double measure running over, but never tedious—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nunquam
sufflaminandus erat</span></i>. He is one of those writers who can
never tire us, not even of himself; and the reason is, he is always
‘full of matter.’ He never runs to lees, never gives us the vapid
leavings of himself, is never ‘weary, stale, and unprofitable,’ but
always setting out afresh on his journey, clearing away some old
nuisance, and turning up new mould. His egotism is delightful, for
there is no affectation in it. He does not talk of himself for lack of
something to write about, but because some circumstance that has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>happened to himself is the best possible illustration of the subject, and
he is not the man to shrink from giving the best possible illustration
of the subject from a squeamish delicacy. He likes both himself
and his subject too well. He does not put himself before it, and say—‘admire
me first’—but places us in the same situation with himself,
and makes us see all that he does. There is no blindman’s-buff, no
conscious hints, no awkward ventriloquism, no testimonies of applause,
no abstract, senseless self-complacency, no smuggled admiration of
his own person by proxy: it is all plain and above-board. He writes
himself plain William Cobbett, strips himself quite as naked as any
body would wish—in a word, his egotism is full of individuality, and
has room for very little vanity in it. We feel delighted, rub our
hands, and draw our chair to the fire, when we come to a passage
of this sort: we know it will be something new and good, manly and
simple, not the same insipid story of self over again. We sit down
at table with the writer, but it is to a course of rich viands, flesh,
fish, and wild-fowl, and not to a nominal entertainment, like that
given by the Barmecide in the Arabian Nights, who put off his
visitors with calling for a number of exquisite things that never
appeared, and with the honour of his company. Mr. Cobbett is not
a <em>make-believe</em> writer. His worst enemy cannot say that of him.
Still less is he a vulgar one. He must be a puny, common-place
critic indeed, who thinks him so. How fine were the graphical
descriptions he sent us from America: what a transatlantic flavour,
what a native <em>gusto</em>, what a fine <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauce-piquante</span></i> of contempt they were
seasoned with! If he had sat down to look at himself in the glass,
instead of looking about him like Adam in Paradise, he would not
have got up these articles in so capital a style. What a noble account
of his first breakfast after his arrival in America! It might serve
for a month. There is no scene on the stage more amusing. How
well he paints the gold and scarlet plumage of the American birds,
only to lament more pathetically the want of the wild wood-notes
of his native land! The groves of the Ohio that had just fallen
beneath the axe’s stroke ‘live in his description,’ and the turnips
that he transplanted from Botley ‘look green’ in prose! How well
at another time he describes the poor sheep that had got the tick, and
had tumbled down in the agonies of death! It is a portrait in the
manner of Bewick, with the strength, the simplicity, and feeling of
that great naturalist. What havoc he makes, when he pleases, of the
curls of Dr. Parr’s wig and of the Whig consistency of Mr. —!
His Grammar too is as entertaining as a story-book. He is too hard
upon the style of others, and not enough (sometimes) on his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a political partisan, no one can stand against him. With his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>brandished club, like Giant Despair in the Pilgrim’s Progress, he
knocks out their brains; and not only no individual, but no corrupt
system could hold out against his powerful and repeated attacks, but
with the same weapon, swung round like a flail, that he levels his
antagonists, he lays his friends low, and puts his own party <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de
combat</span></i>. This is a bad propensity, and a worse principle in political
tactics, though a common one. If his blows were straight forward
and steadily directed to the same object, no unpopular Minister could
live before him; instead of which he lays about right and left,
impartially and remorselessly, makes a clear stage, has all the ring
to himself, and then runs out of it, just when he should stand his
ground. He throws his head into his adversary’s stomach, and
takes away from him all inclination for the fight, hits fair or
foul, strikes at every thing, and as you come up to his aid or
stand ready to pursue his advantage, trips up your heels or lays
you sprawling, and pummels you when down as much to his heart’s
content as ever the Yanguesian carriers belaboured Rosinante with
their pack-staves. ‘<em>He has the back-trick simply the best of any man
in Illyria.</em>’ He pays off both scores of old friendship and new-acquired
enmity in a breath, in one perpetual volley, one raking fire
of ‘arrowy sleet’ shot from his pen. However his own reputation or
the cause may suffer in consequence, he cares not one pin about that,
so that he disables all who oppose, or who pretend to help him. In
fact, he cannot bear success of any kind, not even of his own views
or party; and if any principle were likely to become popular, would
turn round against it to shew his power in shouldering it on one side.
In short, wherever power is, there is he against it: he naturally butts
at all obstacles, as unicorns are attracted to oak-trees, and feels his
own strength only by resistance to the opinions and wishes of the
rest of the world. To sail with the stream, to agree with the company,
is not his humour. If he could bring about a Reform in
Parliament, the odds are that he would instantly fall foul of and try
to mar his own handy-work; and he quarrels with his own creatures
as soon as he has written them into a little vogue—and a prison. I
do not think this is vanity or fickleness so much as a pugnacious disposition,
that must have an antagonist power to contend with, and
only finds itself at ease in systematic opposition. If it were not for
this, the high towers and rotten places of the world would fall before
the battering-ram of his hard-headed reasoning: but if he once found
them tottering, he would apply his strength to prop them up, and
disappoint the expectations of his followers. He cannot agree to
any thing established, nor to set up any thing else in its stead. While
it is established, he presses hard against it, because it presses upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>him, at least in imagination. Let it crumble under his grasp, and the
motive to resistance is gone. He then requires some other grievance
to set his face against. His principle is repulsion, his nature contradiction:
he is made up of mere antipathies, an Ishmaelite indeed
without a fellow. He is always playing at <em>hunt-the-slipper</em> in politics.
He turns round upon whoever is next him. The way to wean him
from any opinion, and make him conceive an intolerable hatred
against it, would be to place somebody near him who was perpetually
dinning it in his ears. When he is in England, he does nothing but
abuse the Boroughmongers, and laugh at the whole system: when he
is in America, he grows impatient of freedom and a republic. If he
had staid there a little longer, he would have become a loyal and a
loving subject of his Majesty King George <span class='fss'>IV.</span> He lampooned the
French Revolution when it was hailed as the dawn of liberty by
millions: by the time it was brought into almost universal ill-odour
by some means or other (partly no doubt by himself) he had turned,
with one or two or three others, staunch Buonapartist. He is always
of the militant, not of the triumphant party: so far he bears a gallant
shew of magnanimity; but his gallantry is hardly of the right stamp.
It wants principle: for though he is not servile or mercenary, he is
the victim of self-will. He must pull down and pull in pieces: it is
not his disposition to do otherwise. It is a pity; for with his great
talents he might do great things, if he would go right forward to any
useful object, make thorough-stitch work of any question, or join hand
and heart with any principle. He changes his opinions as he does
his friends, and much on the same account. He has no comfort in
fixed principles: as soon as any thing is settled in his own mind, he
quarrels with it. He has no satisfaction but in the chase after truth,
runs a question down, worries and kills it, then quits it like vermin,
and starts some new game, to lead him a new dance, and give him a
fresh breathing through bog and brake, with the rabble yelping at his
heels, and the leaders perpetually at fault. This he calls sport-royal.
He thinks it as good as cudgel-playing or single-stick, or any thing
else that has life in it. He likes the cut and thrust, the falls, bruises,
and dry blows of an argument: as to any good or useful results that
may come of the amicable settling of it, any one is welcome to them
for him. The amusement is over, when the matter is once fairly
decided.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is another point of view in which this may be put. I might
say that Mr. Cobbett is a very honest man with a total want of
principle, and I might explain this paradox thus. I mean that he is,
I think, in downright earnest in what he says, in the part he takes at
the time; but in taking that part, he is led entirely by headstrong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>obstinacy, caprice, novelty, pique or personal motive of some sort,
and not by a stedfast regard for truth, or habitual anxiety for what
is right uppermost in his mind. He is not a feed, time-serving,
shuffling advocate (no man could write as he does who did not
believe himself sincere)—but his understanding is the dupe and slave
of his momentary, violent, and irritable humours. He does not
adopt an opinion ‘deliberately or for money;’ yet his conscience is
at the mercy of the first provocation he receives, of the first whim he
takes in his head; he sees things through the medium of heat and
passion, not with reference to any general principles, and his whole
system of thinking is deranged by the first object that strikes his
fancy or sours his temper.—One cause of this phenomenon is perhaps
his want of a regular education. He is a self-taught man, and has
the faults as well as excellences of that class of persons in their most
striking and glaring excess. It must be acknowledged that the
Editor of the Political Register (the <em>two-penny trash</em>, as it was called,
till a bill passed the House to raise the price to sixpence) is not ‘the
gentleman and scholar:’ though he has qualities that, with a little
better management, would be worth (to the public) both those titles.
For want of knowing what has been discovered before him, he has
not certain general landmarks to refer to, or a general standard of
thought to apply to individual cases. He relies on his own acuteness
and the immediate evidence, without being acquainted with the comparative
anatomy or philosophical structure of opinion. He does not
view things on a large scale or at the horizon (dim and airy enough
perhaps)—but as they affect himself, close, palpable, tangible.
Whatever he finds out, is his own, and he only knows what he
finds out. He is in the constant hurry and fever of gestation: his
brain teems incessantly with some fresh project. Every new light
is the birth of a new system, the dawn of a new world to him. He
is continually outstripping and overreaching himself. The last
opinion is the only true one. He is wiser to-day than he was
yesterday. Why should he not be wiser to-morrow than he was
to-day?—Men of a learned education are not so sharp-witted as
clever men without it: but they know the balance of the human
intellect better; if they are more stupid, they are more steady; and
are less liable to be led astray by their own sagacity and the over-weening
petulance of hard-earned and late-acquired wisdom. They
do not fall in love with every meretricious extravagance at first sight,
or mistake an old battered hypothesis for a vestal, because they are
new to the ways of this old world. They do not seize upon it as
a prize, but are safe from gross imposition by being as wise and no
wiser than those who went before them.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Paine said on some occasion—‘What I have written, I have
written’—as rendering any farther declaration of his principles
unnecessary. Not so Mr. Cobbett. What he has written is no
rule to him what he is to write. He learns something every day,
and every week he takes the field to maintain the opinions of the
last six days against friend or foe. I doubt whether this outrageous
inconsistency, this headstrong fickleness, this understood want of all
rule and method, does not enable him to go on with the spirit, vigour,
and variety that he does. He is not pledged to repeat himself.
Every new Register is a kind of new Prospectus. He blesses
himself from all ties and shackles on his understanding; he has no
mortgages on his brain; his notions are free and unincumbered. If
he was put in trammels, he might become a vile hack like so many
more. But he gives himself ‘ample scope and verge enough.’ He
takes both sides of a question, and maintains one as sturdily as the
other. If nobody else can argue against him, he is a very good
match for himself. He writes better in favour of Reform than any
body else; he used to write better against it. Wherever he is, there
is the tug of war, the weight of the argument, the strength of abuse.
He is not like a man in danger of being <em>bed-rid</em> in his faculties—He
tosses and tumbles about his unwieldy bulk, and when he is tired of
lying on one side, relieves himself by turning on the other. His
shifting his point of view from time to time not merely adds variety
and greater compass to his topics (so that the Political Register is
an armoury and magazine for all the materials and weapons of political
warfare), but it gives a greater zest and liveliness to his manner of
treating them. Mr. Cobbett takes nothing for granted as what he
has proved before; he does not write a book of reference. We see
his ideas in their first concoction, fermenting and overflowing with
the ebullitions of a lively conception. We look on at the actual
process, and are put in immediate possession of the grounds and
materials on which he forms his sanguine, unsettled conclusions. He
does not give us samples of reasoning, but the whole solid mass,
refuse and all.</p>

      <div class='line'>As downright Shippen or as old Montaigne.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This is one cause of the clearness and force of his writings. An
argument does not stop to stagnate and muddle in his brain, but
passes at once to his paper. His ideas are served up, like pancakes,
hot and hot. Fresh theories give him fresh courage. He is like a
young and lusty bridegroom that divorces a favourite speculation
every morning, and marries a new one every night. He is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>wedded to his notions, not he. He has not one Mrs. Cobbett
among all his opinions. He makes the most of the last thought that
has come in his way, seizes fast hold of it, rumples it about in all
directions with rough strong hands, has his wicked will of it, takes
a surfeit, and throws it away.—Our author’s changing his opinions
for new ones is not so wonderful: what is more remarkable is his
facility in forgetting his old ones. He does not pretend to consistency
(like Mr. Coleridge); he frankly disavows all connexion
with himself. He feels no personal responsibility in this way, and
cuts a friend or principle with the same decided indifference that
Antipholis of Ephesus cuts Ægeon of Syracuse. It is a hollow
thing. The only time he ever grew romantic was in bringing over
the relics of Mr. Thomas Paine with him from America to go a
progress with them through the disaffected districts. Scarce had he
landed in Liverpool when he left the bones of a great man to shift
for themselves; and no sooner did he arrive in London than he
made a speech to disclaim all participation in the political and
theological sentiments of his late idol, and to place the whole stock
of his admiration and enthusiasm towards him to the account of his
financial speculations, and of his having predicted the fate of paper-money.
If he had erected a little gold statue to him, it might have
proved the sincerity of this assertion: but to make a martyr and a
patron-saint of a man, and to dig up ‘his canonised bones’ in order
to expose them as objects of devotion to the rabble’s gaze, asks
something that has more life and spirit in it, more mind and vivifying
soul, than has to do with any calculation of pounds, shillings,
and pence! The fact is, he <em>ratted</em> from his own project. He found
the thing not so ripe as he had expected. His heart failed him:
his enthusiasm fled, and he made his retractation. His admiration is
short-lived: his contempt only is rooted, and his resentment lasting.—The
above was only one instance of his building too much on
practical <em>data</em>. He has an ill habit of prophesying, and goes on,
though still deceived. The art of prophesying does not suit Mr.
Cobbett’s style. He has a knack of fixing names and times and
places. According to him, the Reformed Parliament was to meet
in March, 1818—it did not, and we heard no more of the matter.
When his predictions fail, he takes no farther notice of them, but
applies himself to new ones—like the country-people who turn to see
what weather there is in the almanac for the next week, though it
has been out in its reckoning every day of the last.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Cobbett is great in attack, not in defence: he cannot fight an
up-hill battle. He will not bear the least punishing. If any one
turns upon him (which few people like to do) he immediately turns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>tail. Like an overgrown school-boy, he is so used to have it all his
own way, that he cannot submit to any thing like competition or a
struggle for the mastery; he must lay on all the blows, and take
none. He is bullying and cowardly; a Big Ben in politics, who
will fall upon others and crush them by his weight, but is not prepared
for resistance, and is soon staggered by a few smart blows. Whenever
he has been set upon he has slunk out of the controversy. The
Edinburgh Review made (what is called) a dead set at him some
years ago, to which he only retorted by an eulogy on the superior
neatness of an English kitchen-garden to a Scotch one. I remember
going one day into a bookseller’s shop in Fleet-street to ask for the
Review; and on my expressing my opinion to a young Scotchman,
who stood behind the counter, that Mr. Cobbett might hit as hard
in his reply, the North Briton said with some alarm—‘But you
don’t think, Sir, Mr. Cobbett will be able to injure the Scottish
nation?’ I said I could not speak to that point, but I thought he
was very well able to defend himself. He however did not, but has
borne a grudge to the Edinburgh Review ever since, which he hates
worse than the Quarterly. I cannot say I do.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY VII<br /> <span class='small'>ON PEOPLE WITH ONE IDEA</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>There are people who have but one idea: at least, if they have
more, they keep it a secret, for they never talk but of one subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is Major C—: he has but one idea or subject of discourse,
Parliamentary Reform. Now Parliamentary Reform is (as
far as I know) a very good thing, a very good idea, and a very good
subject to talk about; but why should it be the only one? To hear
the worthy and gallant Major resume his favourite topic, is like law-business,
or a person who has a suit in Chancery going on. Nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>can be attended to, nothing can be talked of but that. Now it is
getting on, now again it is standing still; at one time the Master has
promised to pass judgment by a certain day, at another he has put
it off again and called for more papers, and both are equally reasons
for speaking of it. Like the piece of packthread in the barrister’s
hands, he turns and twists it all ways, and cannot proceed a step
without it. Some school-boys cannot read but in their own book:
and the man of one idea cannot converse out of his own subject.
Conversation it is not; but a sort of recital of the preamble of a
bill, or a collection of grave arguments for a man’s being of opinion
with himself. It would be well if there was any thing of character,
of eccentricity in all this; but that is not the case. It is a political
homily personified, a walking common-place we have to encounter
and listen to. It is just as if a man was to insist on your hearing
him go through the fifth chapter of the Book of Judges every time
you meet, or like the story of the Cosmogony in the Vicar of
Wakefield. It is a tune played on a barrel-organ. It is a common
vehicle of discourse into which they get and are set down when
they please, without any pains or trouble to themselves. Neither
is it professional pedantry or trading quackery: it has no excuse.
The man has no more to do with the question which he saddles
on all his hearers than you have. This is what makes the matter
hopeless. If a farmer talks to you about his pigs or his poultry,
or a physician about his patients, or a lawyer about his briefs, or
a merchant about stock, or an author about himself, you know how
to account for this, it is a common infirmity, you have a laugh at
his expense, and there is no more to be said. But here is a man
who goes out of his way to be absurd, and is troublesome by a
romantic effort of generosity. You cannot say to him, ‘All this
may be interesting to you, but I have no concern in it:’ you cannot
put him off in that way. He retorts the Latin adage upon you—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil
humani a me alienum puto</span></i>. He has got possession of a subject
which is of universal and paramount interest (not ‘a fee-grief, due
to some single breast’)—and on that plea may hold you by the
button as long as he chooses. His delight is to harangue on what
nowise regards himself: how then can you refuse to listen to what
as little amuses you? Time and tide wait for no man. The
business of the state admits of no delay. The question of Universal
Suffrage and Annual Parliaments stands first on the order of the
day—takes precedence in its own right of every other question.
Any other topic, grave or gay, is looked upon in the light of
impertinence, and sent <em>to Coventry</em>. Business is an interruption;
pleasure a digression from it. It is the question before every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>company where the Major comes, which immediately resolves itself
into a committee of the whole world upon it, is carried on by means
of a perpetual virtual adjournment, and it is presumed that no other
is entertained while this is pending—a determination which gives
its persevering advocate a fair prospect of expatiating on it to his
dying day. As Cicero says of study, it follows him into the
country, it stays with him at home: it sits with him at breakfast,
and goes out with him to dinner. It is like a part of his dress, of
the costume of his person, without which he would be at a loss
what to do. If he meets you in the street, he accosts you with it
as a form of salutation: if you see him at his own house, it is
supposed you come upon that. If you happen to remark, ‘It is
a fine day, or the town is full,’ it is considered as a temporary
compromise of the question; you are suspected of not going the
whole length of the principle. As Sancho when reprimanded for
mentioning his homely favourite in the Duke’s kitchen, defended
himself by saying—‘There I thought of Dapple, and there I spoke
of him’—so the true stickler for Reform neglects no opportunity
of introducing the subject wherever he is. Place its veteran
champion under the frozen north, and he will celebrate sweet
smiling Reform: place him under the mid-day Afric suns, and he
will talk of nothing but Reform—Reform so sweetly smiling and
so sweetly promising for the last forty years—</p>

<p class='c015'>A topic of this sort, of which the person himself may be considered
as almost sole proprietor and patentee, is an estate for life, free from
all incumbrance of wit, thought, or study, you live upon it as a
settled income; and others might as well think to eject you out
of a capital freehold house and estate as think to drive you out of
it into the wide world of common sense and argument. Every
man’s house is his castle; and every man’s common-place is his
stronghold, from which he looks out and smiles at the dust and
heat of controversy, raised by a number of frivolous and vexatious
questions—‘Rings the world with the vain stir!’ A cure for this
and every other evil would be a Parliamentary Reform; and so we
return in a perpetual circle to the point from which we set out. Is
not this a species of sober madness more provoking than the real?
Has not the theoretical enthusiast his mind as much warped, as
much enslaved, by one idea as the acknowledged lunatic, only
that the former has no lucid intervals? If you see a visionary of
this class going along the street, you can tell as well what he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>thinking of and will say next as the man that fancies himself a teapot
or the Czar of Muscovy. The one is as inaccessible to reason
as the other: if the one raves, the other dotes!</p>

<p class='c013'>There are some who fancy the Corn Bill the root of all evil, and
others who trace all the miseries of life to the practice of muffling
up children in night-clothes when they sleep or travel. They will
declaim by the hour together on the first, and argue themselves
black in the face on the last. It is in vain that you give up the
point. They persist in the debate, and begin again—‘But don’t
you see—?’ These sort of partial obliquities, as they are more
entertaining and original, are also by their nature intermittent.
They hold a man but for a season. He may have one a year or
every two years; and though, while he is in the heat of any new
discovery, he will let you hear of nothing else, he varies from
himself, and is amusing undesignedly. He is not like the chimes
at midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>People of the character here spoken of, that is, who tease you to
death with some one idea, generally differ in their favourite notion
from the rest of the world; and indeed it is the love of distinction
which is mostly at the bottom of this peculiarity. Thus one
person is remarkable for living on a vegetable diet, and never fails
to entertain you all dinner-time with an invective against animal
food. One of this self-denying class, who adds to the primitive
simplicity of this sort of food the recommendation of having it in
a raw state, lamenting the death of a patient whom he had augured
to be in a good way as a convert to his system, at last accounted
for his disappointment in a whisper—‘But she ate meat privately,
depend upon it.’ It is not pleasant, though it is what one submits
to willingly from some people, to be asked every time you meet,
whether you have quite left off drinking wine, and to be complimented
or condoled with on your looks according as you answer
in the negative or affirmative. Abernethy thinks his pill an infallible
cure for all disorders. A person once complaining to his
physician that he thought his mode of treatment had not answered,
he assured him it was the best in the world,—‘and as a proof of
it,’ says he, ‘I have had one gentleman, a patient with your disorder,
under the same regimen for the last sixteen years!’—I have known
persons whose minds were entirely taken up at all times and on all
occasions with such questions as the Abolition of the Slave-Trade,
the Restoration of the Jews, or the progress of Unitarianism. I
myself at one period took a pretty strong turn to inveighing against
the doctrine of Divine Right, and am not yet cured of my prejudice
on that subject. How many projectors have gone mad in good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>earnest from incessantly harping on one idea, the discovery of the
philosopher’s stone, the finding out the longitude, or paying off the
national debt! The disorder at length comes to a fatal crisis; but
long before this, and while they were walking about and talking as
usual, the derangement of the fancy, the loss of all voluntary power
to control or alienate their ideas from the single subject that
occupied them, was gradually taking place, and overturning the
fabric of the understanding by wrenching it all on one side.
Alderman Wood has, I should suppose, talked of nothing but the
Queen in all companies for the last six months. Happy Alderman
Wood! Some persons have got a definition of the verb, others a
system of short-hand, others a cure for typhus fever, others a method
for preventing the counterfeiting of bank notes, which they think the
best possible, and indeed the only one. Others insist there have
been only three great men in the world, leaving you to add a fourth.
A man who has been in Germany will sometimes talk of nothing
but what is German: a Scotchman always leads the discourse to his
own country. Some descant on the Kantean philosophy. There
is a conceited fellow about town who talks always and every where
on this subject. He wears the Categories round his neck like a
pearl-chain; he plays off the names of the primary and transcendental
qualities like rings on his fingers. He talks of the Kantean system
while he dances; he talks of it while he dines, he talks of it to
his children, to his apprentices, to his customers. He called on
me to convince me of it, and said I was only prevented from
becoming a complete convert by one or two prejudices. He knows
no more about it than a pike-staff. Why then does he make so
much ridiculous fuss about it? It is not that he has got this one
idea in his head, but that he has got no other. A dunce may talk
on the subject of the Kantean philosophy with great impunity: if
he opened his lips on any other, he might be found out. A French
lady, who had married an Englishman who said little, excused him
by saying—‘He is always thinking of Locke and Newton.’ This
is one way of passing muster by following in the <em>suite</em> of great
names!—A friend of mine, whom I met one day in the street,
accosted me with more than usual vivacity, and said, ‘Well, we’re
selling, we’re selling!’ I thought he meant a house. ‘No,’ he
said, ‘haven’t you seen the advertisement in the newspapers? I
mean five-and-twenty copies of the Essay.’ This work, a comely,
capacious quarto on the most abstruse metaphysics, had occupied
his sole thoughts for several years, and he concluded that I must
be thinking of what he was. I believe, however, I may say I am
nearly the only person that ever read, certainly that ever pretended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>to understand it. It is an original and most ingenious work, nearly
as incomprehensible as it is original, and as quaint as it is ingenious.
If the author is taken up with the ideas in his own head and no
others, he has a right: for he has ideas there, that are to be met
with nowhere else, and which occasionally would not disgrace a
Berkeley. A dextrous plagiarist might get himself an immense
reputation by putting them in a popular dress. Oh! how little do
they know, who have never done any thing but repeat after others by
rote, the pangs, the labour, the yearnings, and misgivings of mind
it costs, to get the germ of an original idea—to dig it out of the
hidden recesses of thought and nature, and bring it half-ashamed,
struggling, and deformed into the day—to give words and intelligible
symbols to that which was never imagined or expressed before! It
is as if the dumb should speak for the first time, as if things should
stammer out their own meaning, through the imperfect organs of
mere sense. I wish that some of our fluent, plausible declaimers,
who have such store of words to cover the want of ideas, could lend
their art to this writer. If he, ‘poor, unfledged’ in this respect,
‘who has scarce winged from view o’ th’ nest,’ could find a language
for his ideas, truth would find a language for some of her secrets.
Mr. Fearn was buried in the woods of Indostan. In his leisure
from business and from tiger-shooting, he took it into his head to
look into his own mind. A whim or two, an odd fancy, like a
film before the eye, now and then crossed it: it struck him as
something curious, but the impression at first disappeared like breath
upon glass. He thought no more of it; yet still the same conscious
feelings returned, and what at first was chance or instinct, became
a habit. Several notions had taken possession of his brain relating
to mental processes which he had never heard alluded to in conversation,
but not being well versed in such matters, he did not
know whether they were to be found in learned authors or not.
He took a journey to the capital of the Peninsula on purpose,
bought Locke, Reid, Stewart, and Berkeley, whom he consulted
with eager curiosity when he got home, but did not find what he
looked for. He set to work himself; and in a few weeks sketched
out a rough draught of his thoughts and observations on bamboo
paper. The eagerness of his new pursuit, together with the diseases
of the climate, proved too much for his constitution, and he was
forced to return to this country. He put his metaphysics, his
bamboo manuscript, into the boat with him, and as he floated
down the Ganges, said to himself, ‘If I live, this will live: if I
die, it will not be heard of.’ What is fame to this feeling? The
babbling of an idiot! He brought the work home with him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>twice had it stereotyped. The first sketch he allowed was obscure,
but the improved copy he thought could not fail to strike. It did
not succeed. The world, as Goldsmith said of himself, made
a point of taking no notice of it. Ever since he has had nothing
but disappointment and vexation—the greatest and most heart-breaking
of all others—that of not being able to make yourself
understood. Mr. Fearn tells me there is a sensible writer in the
Monthly Review who sees the thing in its proper light, and says
so. But I have heard of no other instance. There are, notwithstanding,
ideas in this work, neglected and ill-treated as it has been,
that lead to more curious and subtle speculations on some of the
most disputed and difficult points of the philosophy of the human
mind (such as <em>relation</em>, <em>abstraction</em>, &amp;c.) than have been thrown out
in any work for the last sixty years, I mean since Hume; for since
his time, there has been no metaphysician in this country worth the
name. Yet his Treatise on Human Nature, he tells us, ‘fell stillborn
from the press.’ So it is that knowledge works its way, and
reputation lingers far behind it. But truth is better than opinion, I
maintain it; and as to the two stereotyped and unsold editions of
the Essay on Consciousness, I say, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honi soit qui mal y pense</span></i><a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a>!—My
Uncle Toby had one idea in his head, that of his bowling-green,
and another, that of the Widow Wadman. Oh, spare them both!
I will only add one more anecdote in illustration of this theory of
the mind’s being occupied with one idea, which is most frequently
of a man’s self. A celebrated lyrical writer happened to drop into
a small party where they had just got the novel of Rob Roy, by
the author of Waverley. The motto in the title-page was taken
from a poem of his. This was a hint sufficient, a word to the wise.
He instantly went to the book-shelf in the next room, took down
the volume of his own poems, read the whole of that in question
aloud with manifest complacency, replaced it on the shelf, and
walked away; taking no more notice of Rob Roy than if there had
been no such person, nor of the new novel than if it had not been
written by its renowned author. There was no reciprocity in
this. But the writer in question does not admit of any merit,
second to his own.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Mr. Owen is a man remarkable for one idea. It is that of himself
and the Lanark cotton-mills. He carries this idea backwards and
forwards with him from Glasgow to London, without allowing any
thing for attrition, and expects to find it in the same state of purity
and perfection in the latter place as at the former. He acquires a
wonderful velocity and impenetrability in his undaunted transit.
Resistance to him is vain, while the whirling motion of the mail-coach
remains in his head.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He even got possession, in the suddenness of his onset, of the
steam-engine of the Times Newspaper, and struck off ten thousand
wood-cuts of the Projected Villages, which afforded an ocular
demonstration to all who saw them of the practicability of Mr.
Owen’s whole scheme. He comes into a room with one of these
documents in his hand, with the air of a schoolmaster and a quack-doctor
mixed, asks very kindly how you do, and on hearing you
are still in an indifferent state of health owing to bad digestion,
instantly turns round, and observes, ‘That all that will be remedied
in his plan: that indeed he thinks too much attention has been paid
to the mind, and not enough to the body; that in his system, which
he has now perfected, and which will shortly be generally adopted,
he has provided effectually for both: that he has been long of
opinion that the mind depends altogether on the physical organisation,
and where the latter is neglected or disordered, the former must
languish and want its due vigour: that exercise is therefore a part
of his system, with full liberty to develop every faculty of mind
and body: that two objections had been made to his New View
of Society, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> its want of relaxation from labour, and its want of
variety; but the first of these, the too great restraint, he trusted he
had already answered, for where the powers of mind and body were
freely exercised and brought out, surely liberty must be allowed to
exist in the highest degree; and as to the second, the monotony
which would be produced by a regular and general plan of co-operation,
he conceived he had proved in his “New View” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“Addresses to the higher Classes;” that the co-operation he had
recommended was necessarily conducive to the most extensive
improvement of the ideas and faculties, and where this was the
case, there must be the greatest possible variety instead of a want
of it.’ And having said this, this expert and sweeping orator takes
up his hat and walks down stairs after reading his lecture of truisms
like a play-bill or an apothecary’s advertisement; and should you
stop him at the door to say by way of putting in a word in common,
that Mr. Southey seems somewhat favourable to his plan in his late
Letter to Mr. William Smith, he looks at you with a smile of pity
at the futility of all opposition and the idleness of all encouragement.
People who thus swell out some vapid scheme of their own into
undue importance, seem to me to labour under water in the head—to
exhibit a huge hydrocephalus! They may be very worthy people
for all that, but they are bad companions and very indifferent
reasoners. Tom Moore says of some one somewhere, ‘That he
puts his hand in his breeches’ pocket like a crocodile.’ The phrase
is hieroglyphical: but Mr. Owen and others might be said to put
their foot in the question of social improvement and reform much in
the same unaccountable manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>I hate to be surfeited with any thing, however sweet. I do not
want to be always tied to the same question, as if there were no
other in the world. I like a mind more Catholic.</p>

      <div class='line'>That come from a far countreé.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I am not for ‘a collusion’ but ‘an exchange’ of ideas. It is well
to hear what other people have to say on a number of subjects. I do
not wish to be always respiring the same confined atmosphere, but to
vary the scene, and get a little relief and fresh air out of doors. Do
all we can to shake it off, there is always enough pedantry, egotism,
and self-conceit left lurking behind: we need not seal ourselves up
hermetically in these precious qualities; so as to think of nothing but
our own wonderful discoveries, and hear nothing but the sound of our
own voice. Scholars, like princes, may learn something by being
<em>incognito</em>. Yet we see those who cannot go into a bookseller’s shop,
or bear to be five minutes in a stage-coach, without letting you know
who they are. They carry their reputation about with them as the
snail does its shell, and sit under its canopy, like the lady in the
lobster. I cannot understand this at all. What is the use of a man’s
always revolving round his own little circle? He must, one should
think, be tired of it himself, as well as tire other people. A well-known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>writer says with much boldness both in the thought and
expression, that ‘a Lord is imprisoned in the Bastille of a <em>name</em>, and
cannot enlarge himself into man:’ and I have known men of genius
in the same predicament. Why must a man be for ever mouthing
out his own poetry, comparing himself with Milton, passage by
passage, and weighing every line in a balance of posthumous fame
which he holds in his own hands? It argues a want of imagination
as well as common sense. Has he no ideas but what he has put into
verse; or none in common with his hearers? Why should he think
it the only scholar-like thing, the only ‘virtue extant’ to see the
merit of his writings, and that ‘men were brutes without them?’
Why should he bear a grudge to all art, to all beauty, to all wisdom
that does not spring from his own brain? Or why should he fondly
imagine that there is but one fine thing in the world, namely poetry,
and that he is the only poet in it? It will never do. Poetry is a
very fine thing; but there are other things besides it. Every thing
must have its turn. Does a wise man think to enlarge his comprehension
by turning his eyes only on himself, or hope to conciliate
the admiration of others by scouting, proscribing, and loathing all
that they delight in? He must either have a disproportionate idea
of himself, or be ignorant of the world in which he lives. It is quite
enough to have one class of people born to think the universe made
for them!—It seems also to argue a want of repose, of confidence,
and firm faith in a man’s real pretensions to be always dragging them
forward into the foreground, as if the proverb held here—<em>Out of
sight out of mind</em>. Does he, for instance, conceive that no one would
ever think of his poetry, unless he forced it upon them by repeating
it himself? Does he believe all competition, all allowance of
another’s merit fatal to him? Must he, like Moody in the Country
Girl, lock up the faculties of his admirers in ignorance of all other
fine things, painting, music, the antique, lest they should play truant
to him? Methinks such a proceeding implies no good opinion of his
own genius or their taste:—it is deficient in dignity and in decorum.
Surely if any one is convinced of the reality of an acquisition, he can
bear not to have it spoken of every minute. If he knows he has an
undoubted superiority in any respect, he will not be uneasy because
every one he meets is not in the secret, nor staggered by the report
of rival excellence. One of the first mathematicians and classical
scholars of the day was mentioning it as a compliment to himself that
a cousin of his, a girl from school, had said of him—‘You know
M— is a very plain good sort of a young man, but he is not any
thing at all out of the common.’ L. H. once said to me—‘I
wonder I never heard you speak upon this subject before, which you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>seem to have studied a good deal.’ I answered, ‘Why, we were
not reduced to that, that I know of!’—</p>

<p class='c013'>There are persons, who without being chargeable with the vice
here spoken of, yet ‘stand accountant for as great a sin:’ though not
dull and monotonous, they are vivacious mannerists in their conversation,
and excessive egotists. Though they run over a thousand subjects
in mere gaiety of heart, their delight still flows from one idea,
namely, themselves. Open the book in what page you will, there is
a frontispiece of themselves staring you in the face. They are a sort
of <em>Jacks o’ the Green</em>, with a sprig of laurel, a little tinsel, and a little
smut, but still playing antics and keeping in incessant motion, to
attract attention and extort your pittance of approbation. Whether
they talk of the town or the country, poetry or politics, it comes to
much the same thing. If they talk to you of the town, its diversions,
‘its palaces, its ladies, and its streets,’ they are the delight, the grace,
and ornament of it. If they are describing the charms of the country,
they give no account of any individual spot or object or source of
pleasure but the circumstance of their being there. ‘With them conversing,
we forget all place, all seasons, and their change.’ They
perhaps pluck a leaf or a flower, patronise it, and hand it you to
admire, but select no one feature of beauty or grandeur to dispute the
palm of perfection with their own persons. Their rural descriptions
are mere landscape back-grounds with their own portraits in an
engaging attitude in front. They are not observing or enjoying the
scene, but doing the honours as masters of the ceremonies to nature,
and arbiters of elegance to all humanity. If they tell a love-tale of
enamoured princesses, it is plain they fancy themselves the hero of the
piece. If they discuss poetry, their encomiums still turn on something
genial and unsophisticated, meaning their own style: if they
enter into politics, it is understood that a hint from them to the
potentates of Europe is sufficient. In short, as a lover (talk of what
you will) brings in his mistress at every turn, so these persons contrive
to divert your attention to the same darling object—they are, in
fact, in love with themselves; and, like lovers, should be left to keep
their own company.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The description of persons who have the fewest ideas of all others
are mere authors and readers. It is better to be able neither to
read nor write than to be able to do nothing else. A lounger who
is ordinarily seen with a book in his hand, is (we may be almost
sure) equally without the power or inclination to attend either to
what passes around him, or in his own mind. Such a one may be
said to carry his understanding about with him in his pocket, or to
leave it at home on his library shelves. He is afraid of venturing on
any train of reasoning, or of striking out any observation that is not
mechanically suggested to him by passing his eyes over certain legible
characters; shrinks from the fatigue of thought, which, for want of
practice, becomes insupportable to him; and sits down contented
with an endless wearisome succession of words and half-formed
images, which fill the void of the mind, and continually efface one
another. Learning is, in too many cases, but a foil to common
sense; a substitute for true knowledge. Books are less often made
use of as ‘spectacles’ to look at nature with, than as blinds to keep
out its strong light and shifting scenery from weak eyes and indolent
dispositions. The book-worm wraps himself up in his web of verbal
generalities, and sees only the glimmering shadows of things reflected
from the minds of others. Nature <em>puts him out</em>. The impressions of
real objects, stripped of the disguises of words and voluminous roundabout
descriptions, are blows that stagger him; their variety distracts,
their rapidity exhausts him; and he turns from the bustle, the noise,
and glare, and whirling motion of the world about him (which he
has not an eye to follow in its fantastic changes, nor an understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>to reduce to fixed principles,) to the quiet monotony of the dead
languages, and the less startling and more intelligible combinations of
the letters of the alphabet. It is well, it is perfectly well. ‘Leave
me to my repose,’ is the motto of the sleeping and the dead. You
might as well ask the paralytic to leap from his chair and throw
away his crutch, or, without a miracle, to ‘take up his bed and
walk,’ as expect the learned reader to throw down his book and
think for himself. He clings to it for his intellectual support;
and his dread of being left to himself is like the horror of a vacuum.
He can only breathe a learned atmosphere, as other men breathe
common air. He is a borrower of sense. He has no ideas of his
own, and must live on those of other people. The habit of supplying
our ideas from foreign sources ‘enfeebles all internal strength of
thought,’ as a course of dram-drinking destroys the tone of the
stomach. The faculties of the mind, when not exerted, or when
cramped by custom and authority, become listless, torpid, and unfit
for the purposes of thought or action. Can we wonder at the
languor and lassitude which is thus produced by a life of learned
sloth and ignorance; by poring over lines and syllables that excite
little more idea or interest than if they were the characters of an
unknown tongue, till the eye closes on vacancy, and the book drops
from the feeble hand! I would rather be a wood-cutter, or the
meanest hind, that all day ‘sweats in the eye of Phœbus, and at
night sleeps in Elysium,’ than wear out my life so, ’twixt dreaming
and awake. The learned author differs from the learned student in
this, that the one transcribes what the other reads. The learned
are mere literary drudges. If you set them upon original composition,
their heads turn; they don’t know where they are. The
indefatigable readers of books are like the everlasting copiers of
pictures, who, when they attempt to do any thing of their own, find
they want an eye quick enough, a hand steady enough, and colours
bright enough, to trace the living forms of nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>Any one who has passed through the regular gradations of a
classical education, and is not made a fool by it, may consider
himself as having had a very narrow escape. It is an old remark,
that boys who shine at school do not make the greatest figure when
they grow up and come out into the world. The things, in fact,
which a boy is set to learn at school, and on which his success
depends, are things which do not require the exercise either of the
highest or the most useful faculties of the mind. Memory (and that
of the lowest kind) is the chief faculty called into play, in conning
over and repeating lessons by rote in grammar, in languages, in
geography, arithmetic, &amp;c. so that he who has the most of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>technical memory, with the least turn for other things, which have
a stronger and more natural claim upon his childish attention, will
make the most forward school-boy. The jargon containing the
definitions of the parts of speech, the rules for casting up an account,
or the inflections of a Greek verb, can have no attraction to the
tyro of ten years old, except as they are imposed as a task upon him
by others, or from his feeling the want of sufficient relish or amusement
in other things. A lad with a sickly constitution, and no
very active mind, who can just retain what is pointed out to him,
and has neither sagacity to distinguish nor spirit to enjoy for himself,
will generally be at the head of his form. An idler at school, on
the other hand, is one who has high health and spirits, who has the
free use of his limbs, with all his wits about him, who feels the
circulation of his blood and the motion of his heart, who is ready to
laugh and cry in a breath, and who had rather chase a ball or a
butterfly, feel the open air in his face, look at the fields or the sky,
follow a winding path, or enter with eagerness into all the little
conflicts and interests of his acquaintances and friends, than doze
over a musty spelling-book, repeat barbarous distichs after his master,
sit so many hours pinioned to a writing-desk, and receive his reward
for the loss of time and pleasure in paltry prize-medals at Christmas
and Midsummer. There is indeed a degree of stupidity which
prevents children from learning the usual lessons, or ever arriving at
these puny academic honours. But what passes for stupidity is much
oftener a want of interest, of a sufficient motive to fix the attention,
and force a reluctant application to the dry and unmeaning pursuits of
school-learning. The best capacities are as much above this drudgery,
as the dullest are beneath it. Our men of the greatest genius have
not been most distinguished for their acquirements at school or at the
university.</p>

<p class='c013'>Gray and Collins were among the instances of this wayward disposition.
Such persons do not think so highly of the advantages,
nor can they submit their imaginations so servilely to the trammels of
strict scholastic discipline. There is a certain kind and degree of
intellect in which words take root, but into which things have not
power to penetrate. A mediocrity of talent, with a certain slenderness
of moral constitution, is the soil that produces the most brilliant
specimens of successful prize-essayists and Greek epigrammatists.
It should not be forgotten, that the least respectable character among
modern politicians was the cleverest boy at Eton.</p>

<p class='c013'>Learning is the knowledge of that which is not generally known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to others, and which we can only derive at second-hand from books
or other artificial sources. The knowledge of that which is before
us, or about us, which appeals to our experience, passions, and
pursuits, to the bosoms and businesses of men, is not learning.
Learning is the knowledge of that which none but the learned
know. He is the most learned man who knows the most of what
is farthest removed from common life and actual observation, that is
of the least practical utility, and least liable to be brought to the
test of experience, and that, having been handed down through the
greatest number of intermediate stages, is the most full of uncertainty,
difficulties, and contradictions. It is seeing with the eyes of others,
hearing with their ears, and pinning our faith on their understandings.
The learned man prides himself in the knowledge of names, and
dates, not of men or things. He thinks and cares nothing about his
next-door neighbours, but he is deeply read in the tribes and casts of
the Hindoos and Calmuc Tartars. He can hardly find his way into
the next street, though he is acquainted with the exact dimensions
of Constantinople and Pekin. He does not know whether his oldest
acquaintance is a knave or a fool, but he can pronounce a pompous
lecture on all the principal characters in history. He cannot tell
whether an object is black or white, round or square, and yet he is
a professed master of the laws of optics and the rules of perspective.
He knows as much of what he talks about, as a blind man does of
colours. He cannot give a satisfactory answer to the plainest question,
nor is he ever in the right in any one of his opinions, upon any one
matter of fact that really comes before him, and yet he gives himself
out for an infallible judge on all those points, of which it is impossible
that he or any other person living should know any thing but by conjecture.
He is expert in all the dead and in most of the living
languages; but he can neither speak his own fluently, nor write it
correctly. A person of this class, the second Greek scholar of his
day, undertook to point out several solecisms in Milton’s Latin style;
and in his own performance there is hardly a sentence of common
English. Such was Dr. —. Such is Dr. —. Such was not
Porson. He was an exception that confirmed the general rule,—a
man that, by uniting talents and knowledge with learning, made the
distinction between them more striking and palpable.</p>

<p class='c013'>A mere scholar, who knows nothing but books, must be ignorant
even of them. ‘Books do not teach the use of books.’ How
should he know any thing of a work, who knows nothing of the
subject of it? The learned pedant is conversant with books only as
they are made of other books, and those again of others, without end.
He parrots those who have parroted others. He can translate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>same word into ten different languages, but he knows nothing of the
<em>thing</em> which it means in any one of them. He stuffs his head with
authorities built on authorities, with quotations quoted from quotations,
while he locks up his senses, his understanding, and his heart.
He is unacquainted with the maxims and manners of the world; he
is to seek in the characters of individuals. He sees no beauty in the
face of nature or of art. To him ‘the mighty world of eye and ear’
is hid; and ‘knowledge,’ except at one entrance, ‘quite shut out.’
His pride takes part with his ignorance; and his self-importance
rises with the number of things of which he does not know the value,
and which he therefore despises as unworthy of his notice. He
knows nothing of pictures;—‘of the colouring of Titian, the grace
of Raphael, the purity of Domenichino, the <em>corregiescity</em> of Corregio,
the learning of Poussin, the airs of Guido, the taste of the Caracci,
or the grand contour of Michael Angelo,’—of all those glories of the
Italian and miracles of the Flemish school, which have filled the eyes
of mankind with delight, and to the study and imitation of which
thousands have in vain devoted their lives. These are to him as if
they had never been, a mere dead letter, a bye-word; and no wonder:
for he neither sees nor understands their prototypes in nature. A
print of Rubens’s Watering-place, or Claude’s Enchanted Castle, may
be hanging on the walls of his room for months without his once
perceiving them; and if you point them out to him, he will turn
away from them. The language of nature, or of art (which is
another nature), is one that he does not understand. He repeats
indeed the names of Apelles and Phidias, because they are to be
found in classic authors, and boasts of their works as prodigies,
because they no longer exist; or, when he sees the finest remains of
Grecian art actually before him in the Elgin marbles, takes no other
interest in them than as they lead to a learned dispute, and (which is
the same thing) a quarrel about the meaning of a Greek particle. He
is equally ignorant of music; he ‘knows no touch of it,’ from the
strains of the all-accomplished Mozart to the shepherd’s pipe upon
the mountain. His ears are nailed to his books; and deadened with
the sound of the Greek and Latin tongues, and the din and smithery
of school-learning. Does he know any thing more of poetry? He
knows the number of feet in a verse, and of acts in a play; but of
the soul or spirit he knows nothing. He can turn a Greek ode into
English, or a Latin epigram into Greek verse, but whether either is
worth the trouble, he leaves to the critics. Does he understand ‘the
act and practique part of life’ better than ‘the theorique?’ No.
He knows no liberal or mechanic art; no trade or occupation; no
game of skill or chance. Learning ‘has no skill in surgery,’ in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>agriculture, in building, in working in wood or in iron; it cannot
make any instrument of labour, or use it when made; it cannot
handle the plough or the spade, or the chisel or the hammer; it
knows nothing of hunting or hawking, fishing or shooting, of horses
or dogs, of fencing or dancing, or cudgel-playing, or bowls, or cards,
or tennis, or any thing else. The learned professor of all arts and
sciences cannot reduce any one of them to practice, though he may
contribute an account of them to an Encyclopædia. He has not the
use of his hands or of his feet; he can neither run, nor walk, nor
swim; and he considers all those who actually understand and can
exercise any of these arts of body or mind, as vulgar and mechanical
men;—though to know almost any one of them in perfection requires
long time and practice, with powers originally fitted, and a turn of
mind particularly devoted to them. It does not require more than
this to enable the learned candidate to arrive, by painful study, at a
doctor’s degree and a fellowship, and to eat, drink, and sleep, the
rest of his life!</p>

<p class='c013'>The thing is plain. All that men really understand, is confined to
a very small compass; to their daily affairs and experience; to what
they have an opportunity to know, and motives to study or practise.
The rest is affectation and imposture. The common people have the
use of their limbs; for they live by their labour or skill. They
understand their own business, and the characters of those they have
to deal with; for it is necessary that they should. They have
eloquence to express their passions, and wit at will to express their
contempt and provoke laughter. Their natural use of speech is not
hung up in monumental mockery, in an obsolete language; nor is
their sense of what is ludicrous, or readiness at finding out allusions
to express it, buried in collections of <cite>Anas</cite>. You will hear more
good things on the outside of a stage-coach from London to Oxford,
than if you were to pass a twelvemonth with the under-graduates, or
heads of colleges, of that famous university; and more <em>home</em> truths
are to be learnt from listening to a noisy debate in an alehouse, than
from attending to a formal one in the House of Commons. An
elderly country gentlewoman will often know more of character, and
be able to illustrate it by more amusing anecdotes taken from the
history of what has been said, done, and gossiped in a country town
for the last fifty years, than the best blue-stocking of the age will be
able to glean from that sort of learning which consists in an acquaintance
with all the novels and satirical poems published in the same
period. People in towns, indeed, are woefully deficient in a knowledge
of character, which they see only <em>in the bust</em>, not as a whole-length.
People in the country not only know all that has happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>to a man, but trace his virtues or vices, as they do his features, in
their descent through several generations, and solve some contradiction
in his behaviour by a cross in the breed, half a century ago.
The learned know nothing of the matter, either in town or country.
Above all, the mass of society have common sense, which the learned
in all ages want. The vulgar are in the right when they judge for
themselves; they are wrong when they trust to their blind guides.
The celebrated nonconformist divine, Baxter, was almost stoned to
death by the good women of Kidderminster, for asserting from the
pulpit that ‘hell was paved with infants’ skulls;’ but, by the force of
argument, and of learned quotations from the Fathers, the reverend
preacher at length prevailed over the scruples of his congregation, and
over reason and humanity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the use which has been made of human learning. The
labourers in this vineyard seem as if it was their object to confound
all common sense, and the distinctions of good and evil, by means of
traditional maxims, and preconceived notions, taken upon trust, and
increasing in absurdity, with increase of age. They pile hypothesis
on hypothesis, mountain high, till it is impossible to come at the
plain truth on any question. They see things, not as they are, but
as they find them in books; and ‘wink and shut their apprehensions
up,’ in order that they may discover nothing to interfere with their
prejudices, or convince them of their absurdity. It might be supposed
that the height of human wisdom consisted in maintaining contradictions,
and rendering nonsense sacred. There is no dogma,
however fierce or foolish, to which these persons have not set their
seals, and tried to impose on the understandings of their followers, as
the will of Heaven, clothed with all the terrors and sanctions of
religion. How little has the human understanding been directed to
find out the true and useful! How much ingenuity has been thrown
away in the defence of creeds and systems! How much time and
talents have been wasted in theological controversy, in law, in
politics, in verbal criticism, in judicial astrology, and in finding out
the art of making gold! What actual benefit do we reap from the
writings of a Laud or a Whitgift, or of Bishop Bull or Bishop
Waterland, or Prideaux’ Connections, or Beausobre, or Calmet, or
St. Augustine, or Puffendorf, or Vattel, or from the more literal but
equally learned and unprofitable labours of Scaliger, Cardan, and
Scioppius? How many grains of sense are there in their thousand
folio or quarto volumes? What would the world lose if they were
committed to the flames to-morrow? Or are they not already ‘gone
to the vault of all the Capulets?’ Yet all these were oracles in
their time, and would have scoffed at you or me, at common sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>and human nature, for differing with them. It is our turn to laugh
now.</p>

<p class='c013'>To conclude this subject. The most sensible people to be met
with in society are men of business and of the world, who argue from
what they see and know, instead of spinning cobweb distinctions of
what things ought to be. Women have often more of what is called
<em>good sense</em> than men. They have fewer pretensions; are less implicated
in theories; and judge of objects more from their immediate
and involuntary impression on the mind, and, therefore, more truly
and naturally. They cannot reason wrong; for they do not reason
at all. They do not think or speak by rule; and they have in
general more eloquence and wit, as well as sense, on that account.
By their wit, sense, and eloquence together, they generally contrive
to govern their husbands. Their style, when they write to their
friends (not for the booksellers) is better than that of most authors.—Uneducated
people have most exuberance of invention, and the
greatest freedom from prejudice. Shakespear’s was evidently an
uneducated mind, both in the freshness of his imagination, and in
the variety of his views; as Milton’s was scholastic, in the texture
both of his thoughts and feelings. Shakespear had not been accustomed
to write themes at school in favour of virtue or against vice.
To this we owe the unaffected, but healthy tone of his dramatic
morality. If we wish to know the force of human genius, we should
read Shakespear. If we wish to see the insignificance of human
learning, we may study his commentators.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY IX<br /> <span class='small'>THE INDIAN JUGGLERS</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>Coming forward and seating himself on the ground in his white
dress and tightened turban, the chief of the Indian Jugglers begins
with tossing up two brass balls, which is what any of us could do,
and concludes with keeping up four at the same time, which is what
none of us could do to save our lives, nor if we were to take our
whole lives to do it in. Is it then a trifling power we see at work,
or is it not something next to miraculous? It is the utmost stretch
of human ingenuity, which nothing but the bending the faculties of
body and mind to it from the tenderest infancy with incessant, ever-anxious
application up to manhood, can accomplish or make even
a slight approach to. Man, thou art a wonderful animal, and thy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>ways past finding out! Thou canst do strange things, but thou
turnest them to little account!—To conceive of this effort of extraordinary
dexterity distracts the imagination and makes admiration
breathless. Yet it costs nothing to the performer, any more than if
it were a mere mechanical deception with which he had nothing to
do but to watch and laugh at the astonishment of the spectators.
A single error of a hair’s-breadth, of the smallest conceivable portion
of time, would be fatal: the precision of the movements must be
like a mathematical truth, their rapidity is like lightning. To catch
four balls in succession in less than a second of time, and deliver
them back so as to return with seeming consciousness to the hand
again, to make them revolve round him at certain intervals, like the
planets in their spheres, to make them chase one another like sparkles
of fire, or shoot up like flowers or meteors, to throw them behind
his back and twine them round his neck like ribbons or like serpents,
to do what appears an impossibility, and to do it with all the ease,
the grace, the carelessness imaginable, to laugh at, to play with the
glittering mockeries, to follow them with his eye as if he could
fascinate them with its lambent fire, or as if he had only to see that
they kept time with the music on the stage—there is something in all
this which he who does not admire may be quite sure he never really
admired any thing in the whole course of his life. It is skill surmounting
difficulty, and beauty triumphing over skill. It seems as
if the difficulty once mastered naturally resolved itself into ease and
grace, and as if to be overcome at all, it must be overcome without an
effort. The smallest awkwardness or want of pliancy or self-possession
would stop the whole process. It is the work of witchcraft, and yet
sport for children. Some of the other feats are quite as curious and
wonderful, such as the balancing the artificial tree and shooting a bird
from each branch through a quill; though none of them have the
elegance or facility of the keeping up of the brass balls. You are in
pain for the result, and glad when the experiment is over; they are
not accompanied with the same unmixed, unchecked delight as the
former; and I would not give much to be merely astonished without
being pleased at the same time. As to the swallowing of the sword,
the police ought to interfere to prevent it. When I saw the Indian
Juggler do the same things before, his feet were bare, and he had
large rings on the toes, which kept turning round all the time of the
performance, as if they moved of themselves.—The hearing a speech
in Parliament, drawled or stammered out by the Honourable Member
or the Noble Lord, the ringing the changes on their common-places,
which any one could repeat after them as well as they, stirs me not a
jot, shakes not my good opinion of myself: but the seeing the Indian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Jugglers does. It makes me ashamed of myself. I ask what there
is that I can do as well as this? Nothing. What have I been
doing all my life? Have I been idle, or have I nothing to shew for
all my labour and pains? Or have I passed my time in pouring
words like water into empty sieves, rolling a stone up a hill and
then down again, trying to prove an argument in the teeth of facts,
and looking for causes in the dark, and not finding them? Is there
no one thing in which I can challenge competition, that I can bring
as an instance of exact perfection, in which others cannot find a flaw?
The utmost I can pretend to is to write a description of what this
fellow can do. I can write a book: so can many others who have
not even learned to spell. What abortions are these Essays! What
errors, what ill-pieced transitions, what crooked reasons, what lame
conclusions! How little is made out, and that little how ill! Yet
they are the best I can do. I endeavour to recollect all I have ever
observed or thought upon a subject, and to express it as nearly as I
can. Instead of writing on four subjects at a time, it is as much as
I can manage to keep the thread of one discourse clear and unentangled.
I have also time on my hands to correct my opinions,
and polish my periods: but the one I cannot, and the other I
will not do. I am fond of arguing: yet with a good deal of pains
and practice it is often as much as I can do to beat my man; though
he may be a very indifferent hand. A common fencer would
disarm his adversary in the twinkling of an eye, unless he were
a professor like himself. A stroke of wit will sometimes produce
this effect, but there is no such power or superiority in sense or
reasoning. There is no complete mastery of execution to be
shewn there: and you hardly know the professor from the impudent
pretender or the mere clown.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>I have always had this feeling of the inefficacy and slow progress
of intellectual compared to mechanical excellence, and it has always
made me somewhat dissatisfied. It is a great many years since I
saw Richer, the famous rope-dancer, perform at Sadler’s Wells.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>He was matchless in his art, and added to his extraordinary skill
exquisite ease, and unaffected natural grace. I was at that time
employed in copying a half-length picture of Sir Joshua Reynolds’s;
and it put me out of conceit with it. How ill this part was made
out in the drawing! How heavy, how slovenly this other was
painted! I could not help saying to myself, ‘If the rope-dancer
had performed his task in this manner, leaving so many gaps and
botches in his work, he would have broke his neck long ago; I
should never have seen that vigorous elasticity of nerve and precision
of movement!’—Is it then so easy an undertaking (comparatively)
to dance on a tight-rope? Let any one, who thinks so, get up and
try. There is the thing. It is that which at first we cannot do
at all, which in the end is done to such perfection. To account
for this in some degree, I might observe that mechanical dexterity
is confined to doing some one particular thing, which you can
repeat as often as you please, in which you know whether you
succeed or fail, and where the point of perfection consists in succeeding
in a given undertaking.—In mechanical efforts, you improve
by perpetual practice, and you do so infallibly, because the object
to be attained is not a matter of taste or fancy or opinion, but of
actual experiment, in which you must either do the thing or not
do it. If a man is put to aim at a mark with a bow and arrow,
he must hit it or miss it, that’s certain. He cannot deceive himself,
and go on shooting wide or falling short, and still fancy that he
is making progress. The distinction between right and wrong,
between true and false, is here palpable; and he must either correct
his aim or persevere in his error with his eyes open, for which there
is neither excuse nor temptation. If a man is learning to dance
on a rope, if he does not mind what he is about, he will break his
neck. After that, it will be in vain for him to argue that he did
not make a false step. His situation is not like that of Goldsmith’s
pedagogue.—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In argument they own’d his wondrous skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>And e’en though vanquish’d, he could argue still.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Danger is a good teacher, and makes apt scholars. So are disgrace,
defeat, exposure to immediate scorn and laughter. There is no
opportunity in such cases for self-delusion, no idling time away,
no being off your guard (or you must take the consequences)—neither
is there any room for humour or caprice or prejudice. If
the Indian Juggler were to play tricks in throwing up the three
case-knives, which keep their positions like the leaves of a crocus
in the air, he would cut his fingers. I can make a very bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>antithesis without cutting my fingers. The tact of style is more
ambiguous than that of double-edged instruments. If the Juggler
were told that by flinging himself under the wheels of the Juggernaut,
when the idol issues forth on a gaudy day, he would immediately
be transported into Paradise, he might believe it, and nobody could
disprove it. So the Brahmins may say what they please on that
subject, may build up dogmas and mysteries without end, and not
be detected: but their ingenious countryman cannot persuade the
frequenters of the Olympic Theatre that he performs a number
of astonishing feats without actually giving proofs of what he says.—There
is then in this sort of manual dexterity, first a gradual
aptitude acquired to a given exertion of muscular power, from
constant repetition, and in the next place, an exact knowledge
how much is still wanting and necessary to be supplied. The
obvious test is to increase the effort or nicety of the operation,
and still to find it come true. The muscles ply instinctively to
the dictates of habit. Certain movements and impressions of the
hand and eye, having been repeated together an infinite number of
times, are unconsciously but unavoidably cemented into closer and
closer union; the limbs require little more than to be put in motion
for them to follow a regular track with ease and certainty; so that
the mere intention of the will acts mathematically, like touching
the spring of a machine, and you come with Locksley in Ivanhoe,
in shooting at a mark, ‘to allow for the wind.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Farther, what is meant by perfection in mechanical exercises is
the performing certain feats to a uniform nicety, that is, in fact,
undertaking no more than you can perform. You task yourself,
the limit you fix is optional, and no more than human industry and
skill can attain to: but you have no abstract, independent standard
of difficulty or excellence (other than the extent of your own
powers). Thus he who can keep up four brass balls does this <em>to
perfection</em>; but he cannot keep up five at the same instant, and would
fail every time he attempted it. That is, the mechanical performer
undertakes to emulate himself, not to equal another.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a> But the
artist undertakes to imitate another, or to do what nature has done,
and this it appears is more difficult, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> to copy what she has set
before us in the face of nature or ‘human face divine,’ entire and
without a blemish, than to keep up four brass balls at the same
instant; for the one is done by the power of human skill and
industry, and the other never was nor will be. Upon the whole,
therefore, I have more respect for Reynolds, than I have for Richer;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>for, happen how it will, there have been more people in the world
who could dance on a rope like the one than who could paint like
Sir Joshua. The latter was but a bungler in his profession to the
other, it is true; but then he had a harder task-master to obey,
whose will was more wayward and obscure, and whose instructions
it was more difficult to practise. You can put a child apprentice
to a tumbler or rope-dancer with a comfortable prospect of success,
if they are but sound of wind and limb: but you cannot do the
same thing in painting. The odds are a million to one. You may
make indeed as many H—s and H—s, as you put into that
sort of machine, but not one Reynolds amongst them all, with his
grace, his grandeur, his blandness of <em>gusto</em>, ‘in tones and gestures
hit,’ unless you could make the man over again. To snatch this
grace beyond the reach of art is then the height of art—where fine
art begins, and where mechanical skill ends. The soft suffusion of
the soul, the speechless breathing eloquence, the looks ‘commercing
with the skies,’ the ever-shifting forms of an eternal principle, that
which is seen but for a moment, but dwells in the heart always,
and is only seized as it passes by strong and secret sympathy, must
be taught by nature and genius, not by rules or study. It is
suggested by feeling, not by laborious microscopic inspection: in
seeking for it without, we lose the harmonious clue to it within:
and in aiming to grasp the substance, we let the very spirit of art
evaporate. In a word, the objects of fine art are not the objects
of sight but as these last are the objects of taste and imagination,
that is, as they appeal to the sense of beauty, of pleasure, and of
power in the human breast, and are explained by that finer sense,
and revealed in their inner structure to the eye in return. Nature
is also a language. Objects, like words, have a meaning; and the
true artist is the interpreter of this language, which he can only do
by knowing its application to a thousand other objects in a thousand
other situations. Thus the eye is too blind a guide of itself to
distinguish between the warm or cold tone of a deep blue sky, but
another sense acts as a monitor to it, and does not err. The
colour of the leaves in autumn would be nothing without the feeling
that accompanies it; but it is that feeling that stamps them on the
canvas, faded, seared, blighted, shrinking from the winter’s flaw,
and makes the sight as true as touch—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And visions, as poetic eyes avow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cling to each leaf and hang on every bough.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The more ethereal, evanescent, more refined and sublime part of
art is the seeing nature through the medium of sentiment and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>passion, as each object is a symbol of the affections and a link in
the chain of our endless being. But the unravelling this mysterious
web of thought and feeling is alone in the Muse’s gift, namely, in
the power of that trembling sensibility which is awake to every
change and every modification of its ever-varying impressions,
that,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Thrills in each nerve, and lives along the line.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This power is indifferently called genius, imagination, feeling,
taste; but the manner in which it acts upon the mind can neither be
defined by abstract rules, as is the case in science, nor verified by
continual unvarying experiments, as is the case in mechanical performances.
The mechanical excellence of the Dutch painters in
colouring and handling is that which comes the nearest in fine art to
the perfection of certain manual exhibitions of skill. The truth of
the effect and the facility with which it is produced are equally
admirable. Up to a certain point, every thing is faultless. The
hand and eye have done their part. There is only a want of taste
and genius. It is after we enter upon that enchanted ground that the
human mind begins to droop and flag as in a strange road, or in a
thick mist, benighted and making little way with many attempts and
many failures, and that the best of us only escape with half a triumph.
The undefined and the imaginary are the regions that we must pass
like Satan, difficult and doubtful, ‘half flying, half on foot.’ The
object in sense is a positive thing, and execution comes with practice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cleverness is a certain <em>knack</em> or aptitude at doing certain things,
which depend more on a particular adroitness and off-hand readiness
than on force or perseverance, such as making puns, making epigrams,
making extempore verses, mimicking the company, mimicking a style,
&amp;c. Cleverness is either liveliness and smartness, or something
answering to <em>sleight of hand</em>, like letting a glass fall sideways off a
table, or else a trick, like knowing the secret spring of a watch.
Accomplishments are certain external graces, which are to be learnt
from others, and which are easily displayed to the admiration of the
beholder, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> dancing, riding, fencing, music, and so on. These
ornamental acquirements are only proper to those who are at ease in
mind and fortune. I know an individual who if he had been born to
an estate of five thousand a year, would have been the most accomplished
gentleman of the age. He would have been the delight and
envy of the circle in which he moved—would have graced by his
manners the liberality flowing from the openness of his heart, would
have laughed with the women, have argued with the men, have said
good things and written agreeable ones, have taken a hand at piquet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>or the lead at the harpsichord, and have set and sung his own verses—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nugæ
canoræ</span></i>—with tenderness and spirit; a Rochester without the
vice, a modern Surrey! As it is, all these capabilities of excellence
stand in his way. He is too versatile for a professional man, not dull
enough for a political drudge, too gay to be happy, too thoughtless to
be rich. He wants the enthusiasm of the poet, the severity of the
prose-writer, and the application of the man of business.—Talent is
the capacity of doing any thing that depends on application and
industry, such as writing a criticism, making a speech, studying the
law. Talent differs from genius, as voluntary differs from involuntary
power. Ingenuity is genius in trifles, greatness is genius in undertakings
of much pith and moment. A clever or ingenious man is one
who can do any thing well, whether it is worth doing or not: a great
man is one who can do that which when done is of the highest
importance. Themistocles said he could not play on the flute, but
that he could make of a small city a great one. This gives one a
pretty good idea of the distinction in question.</p>

<p class='c013'>Greatness is great power, producing great effects. It is not enough
that a man has great power in himself, he must shew it to all the
world in a way that cannot be hid or gainsaid. He must fill up a
certain idea in the public mind. I have no other notion of greatness
than this two-fold definition, great results springing from great inherent
energy. The great in visible objects has relation to that which
extends over space: the great in mental ones has to do with space
and time. No man is truly great, who is great only in his life-time.
The test of greatness is the page of history. Nothing can be said to
be great that has a distinct limit, or that borders on something
evidently greater than itself. Besides, what is short-lived and pampered
into mere notoriety, is of a gross and vulgar quality in itself.
A Lord Mayor is hardly a great man. A city orator or patriot of
the day only shew, by reaching the height of their wishes, the
distance they are at from any true ambition. Popularity is neither
fame nor greatness. A king (as such) is not a great man. He has
great power, but it is not his own. He merely wields the lever of
the state, which a child, an idiot, or a madman can do. It is the
office, not the man we gaze at. Any one else in the same situation
would be just as much an object of abject curiosity. We laugh at
the country girl who having seen a king expressed her disappointment
by saying, ‘Why, he is only a man!’ Yet, knowing this, we run
to see a king as if he was something more than a man.—To display
the greatest powers, unless they are applied to great purposes, makes
nothing for the character of greatness. To throw a barley-corn
through the eye of a needle, to multiply nine figures by nine in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>memory, argues infinite dexterity of body and capacity of mind, but
nothing comes of either. There is a surprising power at work, but
the effects are not proportionate, or such as take hold of the imagination.
To impress the idea of power on others, they must be made in
some way to feel it. It must be communicated to their understandings
in the shape of an increase of knowledge, or it must subdue
and overawe them by subjecting their wills. Admiration, to be solid
and lasting, must be founded on proofs from which we have no means
of escaping; it is neither a slight nor a voluntary gift. A mathematician
who solves a profound problem, a poet who creates an image
of beauty in the mind that was not there before, imparts knowledge
and power to others, in which his greatness and his fame consists,
and on which it reposes. Jedediah Buxton will be forgotten; but
Napier’s bones will live. Lawgivers, philosophers, founders of
religion, conquerors and heroes, inventors and great geniuses in arts
and sciences, are great men; for they are great public benefactors,
or formidable scourges to mankind. Among ourselves, Shakespear,
Newton, Bacon, Milton, Cromwell, were great men; for they shewed
great power by acts and thoughts, which have not yet been consigned
to oblivion. They must needs be men of lofty stature, whose
shadows lengthen out to remote posterity. A great farce-writer may
be a great man; for Moliere was but a great farce-writer. In my
mind, the author of Don Quixote was a great man. So have there
been many others. A great chess-player is not a great man, for he
leaves the world as he found it. No act terminating in itself constitutes
greatness. This will apply to all displays of power or trials
of skill, which are confined to the momentary, individual effort, and
construct no permanent image or trophy of themselves without them.
Is not an actor then a great man, because ‘he dies and leaves the
world no copy?’ I must make an exception for Mrs. Siddons, or
else give up my definition of greatness for her sake. A man at the
top of his profession is not therefore a great man. He is great in
his way, but that is all, unless he shews the marks of a great moving
intellect, so that we trace the master-mind, and can sympathise with
the springs that urge him on. The rest is but a craft or <em>mystery</em>.
John Hunter was a great man—<em>that</em> any one might see without the
smallest skill in surgery. His style and manner shewed the man.
He would set about cutting up the carcase of a whale with the same
greatness of <em>gusto</em> that Michael Angelo would have hewn a block of
marble. Lord Nelson was a great naval commander; but for myself,
I have not much opinion of a sea-faring life. Sir Humphry Davy is
a great chemist, but I am not sure that he is a great man. I am not
a bit the wiser for any of his discoveries, nor I never met with any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>one that was. But it is in the nature of greatness to propagate an
idea of itself, as wave impels wave, circle without circle. It is a
contradiction in terms for a coxcomb to be a great man. A really
great man has always an idea of something greater than himself. I
have observed that certain sectaries and polemical writers have no
higher compliment to pay their most shining lights than to say that
‘Such a one was a considerable man in his day.’ Some new elucidation
of a text sets aside the authority of the old interpretation, and a
‘great scholar’s memory outlives him half a century,’ at the utmost.
A rich man is not a great man, except to his dependants and his
steward. A lord is a great man in the idea we have of his ancestry,
and probably of himself, if we know nothing of him but his title. I
have heard a story of two bishops, one of whom said (speaking of
St. Peter’s at Rome) that when he first entered it, he was rather
awe-struck, but that as he walked up it, his mind seemed to swell and
dilate with it, and at last to fill the whole building—the other said
that as he saw more of it, he appeared to himself to grow less and
less every step he took, and in the end to dwindle into nothing.
This was in some respects a striking picture of a great and little
mind—for greatness sympathises with greatness, and littleness shrinks
into itself. The one might have become a Wolsey; the other was
only fit to become a Mendicant Friar—or there might have been
court-reasons for making him a bishop. The French have to me a
character of littleness in all about them; but they have produced
three great men that belong to every country, Moliere, Rabelais, and
Montaigne.</p>

<p class='c013'>To return from this digression, and conclude the Essay. A
singular instance of manual dexterity was shewn in the person of the
late John Cavanagh, whom I have several times seen. His death
was celebrated at the time in an article in the Examiner newspaper
(Feb. 7, 1819), written apparently between jest and earnest: but as
it is <em>pat</em> to our purpose, and falls in with my own way of considering
such subjects, I shall here take leave to quote it.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Died at his house in Burbage-street, St. Giles’s, John Cavanagh,
the famous hand fives-player. When a person dies, who does any
one thing better than any one else in the world, which so many
others are trying to do well, it leaves a gap in society. It is not
likely that any one will now see the game of fives played in its
perfection for many years to come—for Cavanagh is dead, and has
not left his peer behind him. It may be said that there are things of
more importance than striking a ball against a wall—there are things
indeed which make more noise and do as little good, such as making
war and peace, making speeches and answering them, making verses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>and blotting them; making money and throwing it away. But the
game of fives is what no one despises who has ever played at it. It
is the finest exercise for the body, and the best relaxation for the
mind. The Roman poet said that “Care mounted behind the horseman
and stuck to his skirts.” But this remark would not have
applied to the fives-player. He who takes to playing at fives is
twice young. He feels neither the past nor future “in the instant.”
Debts, taxes, “domestic treason, foreign levy, nothing can touch
him further.” He has no other wish, no other thought, from the
moment the game begins, but that of striking the ball, of placing it,
of <em>making</em> it! This Cavanagh was sure to do. Whenever he touched
the ball, there was an end of the chase. His eye was certain, his
hand fatal, his presence of mind complete. He could do what he
pleased, and he always knew exactly what to do. He saw the
whole game, and played it; took instant advantage of his adversary’s
weakness, and recovered balls, as if by a miracle and from sudden
thought, that every one gave for lost. He had equal power and
skill, quickness, and judgment. He could either out-wit his antagonist
by finesse, or beat him by main strength. Sometimes, when
he seemed preparing to send the ball with the full swing of his arm,
he would by a slight turn of his wrist drop it within an inch of the
line. In general, the ball came from his hand, as if from a racket,
in a straight horizontal line; so that it was in vain to attempt to overtake
or stop it. As it was said of a great orator that he never was at
a loss for a word, and for the properest word, so Cavanagh always
could tell the degree of force necessary to be given to a ball, and the
precise direction in which it should be sent. He did his work with
the greatest ease; never took more pains than was necessary; and
while others were fagging themselves to death, was as cool and
collected as if he had just entered the court. His style of play was
as remarkable as his power of execution. He had no affectation, no
trifling. He did not throw away the game to show off an attitude,
or try an experiment. He was a fine, sensible, manly player, who
did what he could, but that was more than any one else could even
affect to do. His blows were not undecided and ineffectual—lumbering
like Mr. Wordsworth’s epic poetry, nor wavering like Mr.
Coleridge’s lyric prose, nor short of the mark like Mr. Brougham’s
speeches, nor wide of it like Mr. Canning’s wit, nor foul like the
<cite>Quarterly</cite>, not <em>let</em> balls like the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>. Cobbett and
Junius together would have made a Cavanagh. He was the best
<em>up-hill</em> player in the world; even when his adversary was fourteen,
he would play on the same or better, and as he never flung away the
game through carelessness and conceit, he never gave it up through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>laziness or want of heart. The only peculiarity of his play was
that he never <em>volleyed</em>, but let the balls hop; but if they rose an inch
from the ground, he never missed having them. There was not only
nobody equal, but nobody second to him. It is supposed that he
could give any other player half the game, or beat him with his left
hand. His service was tremendous. He once played Woodward
and Meredith together (two of the best players in England) in the
Fives-court, St. Martin’s-street, and made seven and twenty aces
following by services alone—a thing unheard of. He another time
played Peru, who was considered a first-rate fives-player, a match of
the best out of five games, and in the three first games, which of
course decided the match, Peru got only one ace. Cavanagh was
an Irishman by birth, and a house-painter by profession. He had
once laid aside his working-dress, and walked up, in his smartest
clothes, to the Rosemary Branch to have an afternoon’s pleasure.
A person accosted him, and asked him if he would have a game.
So they agreed to play for half-a-crown a game, and a bottle of
cider. The first game began—it was seven, eight, ten, thirteen,
fourteen, all. Cavanagh won it. The next was the same. They
played on, and each game was hardly contested. “There,” said
the unconscious fives-player, “there was a stroke that Cavanagh could
not take: I never played better in my life, and yet I can’t win a
game. I don’t know how it is.” However, they played on,
Cavanagh winning every game, and the by-standers drinking the
cider, and laughing all the time. In the twelfth game, when
Cavanagh was only four, and the stranger thirteen, a person came in,
and said, “What! are you here, Cavanagh?” The words were no
sooner pronounced than the astonished player let the ball drop from
his hand, and saying, “What! have I been breaking my heart all
this time to beat Cavanagh?” refused to make another effort. “And
yet, I give you my word,” said Cavanagh, telling the story with
some triumph, “I played all the while with my clenched fist.”—He
used frequently to play matches at Copenhagen-house for wagers
and dinners. The wall against which they play is the same that
supports the kitchen-chimney, and when the wall resounded louder
than usual, the cooks exclaimed, “Those are the Irishman’s balls,”
and the joints trembled on the spit!—Goldsmith consoled himself that
there were places where he too was admired: and Cavanagh was the
admiration of all the fives-courts, where he ever played. Mr. Powell,
when he played matches in the Court in St. Martin’s-street, used to
fill his gallery at half a crown a head, with amateurs and admirers of
talent in whatever department it is shown. He could not have shown
himself in any ground in England, but he would have been immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>surrounded with inquisitive gazers, trying to find out in what part of
his frame his unrivalled skill lay, as politicians wonder to see the
balance of Europe suspended in Lord Castlereagh’s face, and admire
the trophies of the British Navy lurking under Mr. Croker’s hanging
brow. Now Cavanagh was as good-looking a man as the Noble
Lord, and much better looking than the Right Hon. Secretary.
He had a clear, open countenance, and did not look sideways or
down, like Mr. Murray the bookseller. He was a young fellow of
sense, humour, and courage. He once had a quarrel with a waterman
at Hungerford-stairs, and, they say, served him out in great style.
In a word, there are hundreds at this day, who cannot mention
his name without admiration, as the best fives-player that perhaps
ever lived (the greatest excellence of which they have any notion)—and
the noisy shout of the ring happily stood him in stead of the
unheard voice of posterity!—The only person who seems to have
excelled as much in another way as Cavanagh did in his, was the
late John Davies, the racket-player. It was remarked of him that
he did not seem to follow the ball, but the ball seemed to follow
him. Give him a foot of wall, and he was sure to make the ball.
The four best racket-players of that day were Jack Spines, Jem.
Harding, Armitage, and Church. Davies could give any one of
these two hands a time, that is, half the game, and each of these,
at their best, could give the best player now in London the same
odds. Such are the gradations in all exertions of human skill and
art. He once played four capital players together, and beat them.
He was also a first-rate tennis-player, and an excellent fives-player.
In the Fleet or King’s Bench, he would have stood against Powell,
who was reckoned the best open-ground player of his time. This
last-mentioned player is at present the keeper of the Fives-court, and
we might recommend to him for a motto over his door—“Who enters
here, forgets himself, his country, and his friends.” And the best
of it is, that by the calculation of the odds, none of the three are
worth remembering!—Cavanagh died from the bursting of a blood-vessel,
which prevented him from playing for the last two or three
years. This, he was often heard to say, he thought hard upon him.
He was fast recovering, however, when he was suddenly carried off,
to the regret of all who knew him. As Mr. Peel made it a qualification
of the present Speaker, Mr. Manners Sutton, that he was an
excellent moral character, so Jack Cavanagh was a zealous Catholic,
and could not be persuaded to eat meat on a Friday, the day on
which he died. We have paid this willing tribute to his memory.</p>

<p class='c013'>I never was in a better place or humour than I am at present for

(the only thing that makes me abhor myself), I have three hours

do it at once as to have it to do for a week to come.</p>

a harder one. It asks a troublesome effort to ensure the admiration

<p class='c015'>my mind takes its flight through too long a series of years, supported
only by the patience of thought and secret yearnings after truth and
good, for me to be at a loss to understand the feeling I intend to
write about; but I do not know that this will enable me to convey
it more agreeably to the reader.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady G. in a letter to Miss Harriet Byron, assures her that ‘her
brother Sir Charles lived to himself:’ and Lady L. soon after (for
Richardson was never tired of a good thing) repeats the same
observation; to which Miss Byron frequently returns in her answers
to both sisters—‘For you know Sir Charles lives to himself,’ till at
length it passes into a proverb among the fair correspondents. This
is not, however, an example of what I understand by <em>living to one’s-self</em>,
for Sir Charles Grandison was indeed always thinking of
himself; but by this phrase I mean never thinking at all about
one’s-self, any more than if there was no such person in existence.
The character I speak of is as little of an egotist as possible:
Richardson’s great favourite was as much of one as possible. Some
satirical critic has represented him in Elysium ‘bowing over the
<em>faded</em> hand of Lady Grandison’ (Miss Byron that was)—he ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>to have been represented bowing over his own hand, for he never
admired any one but himself, and was the god of his own idolatry.
Neither do I call it living to one’s-self to retire into a desert (like
the saints and martyrs of old) to be devoured by wild beasts, nor
to descend into a cave to be considered as a hermit, nor to get to
the top of a pillar or rock to do fanatic penance and be seen of all
men. What I mean by living to one’s-self is living in the world,
as in it, not of it: it is as if no one knew there was such a person,
and you wished no one to know it: it is to be a silent spectator
of the mighty scene of things, not an object of attention or curiosity
in it; to take a thoughtful, anxious interest in what is passing in
the world, but not to feel the slightest inclination to make or meddle
with it. It is such a life as a pure spirit might be supposed to lead,
and such an interest as it might take in the affairs of men, calm,
contemplative, passive, distant, touched with pity for their sorrows,
smiling at their follies without bitterness, sharing their affections,
but not troubled by their passions, not seeking their notice, nor once
dreamt of by them. He who lives wisely to himself and to his own
heart, looks at the busy world through the loop-holes of retreat, and
does not want to mingle in the fray. ‘He hears the tumult, and
is still.’ He is not able to mend it, nor willing to mar it. He
sees enough in the universe to interest him without putting himself
forward to try what he can do to fix the eyes of the universe upon
him. Vain the attempt! He reads the clouds, he looks at the
stars, he watches the return of the seasons, the falling leaves of
autumn, the perfumed breath of spring, starts with delight at the
note of a thrush in a copse near him, sits by the fire, listens to
the moaning of the wind, pores upon a book, or discourses the
freezing hours away, or melts down hours to minutes in pleasing
thought. All this while he is taken up with other things, forgetting
himself. He relishes an author’s style, without thinking of turning
author. He is fond of looking at a print from an old picture in
the room, without teasing himself to copy it. He does not fret
himself to death with trying to be what he is not, or to do what he
cannot. He hardly knows what he is capable of, and is not in the
least concerned whether he shall ever make a figure in the world.
He feels the truth of the lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The man whose eye is ever on himself,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doth look on one, the least of nature’s works;</div>
      <div class='line'>One who might move the wise man to that scorn</div>
      <div class='line'>Which wisdom holds unlawful ever’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>he looks out of himself at the wide extended prospect of nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and takes an interest beyond his narrow pretensions in general
humanity. He is free as air, and independent as the wind.
Woe be to him when he first begins to think what others say of
him. While a man is contented with himself and his own resources,
all is well. When he undertakes to play a part on the stage, and
to persuade the world to think more about him than they do about
themselves, he is got into a track where he will find nothing but
briars and thorns, vexation and disappointment. I can speak a
little to this point. For many years of my life I did nothing but
think. I had nothing else to do but solve some knotty point, or
dip in some abstruse author, or look at the sky, or wander by the
pebbled sea-side—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To see the children sporting on the shore,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>I cared for nothing, I wanted nothing. I took my time to consider
whatever occurred to me, and was in no hurry to give a sophistical
answer to a question—there was no printer’s devil waiting for me.
I used to write a page or two perhaps in half a year; and remember
laughing heartily at the celebrated experimentalist Nicholson, who
told me that in twenty years he had written as much as would make
three hundred octavo volumes. If I was not a great author, I could
read with ever fresh delight, ‘never ending, still beginning,’ and had
no occasion to write a criticism when I had done. If I could not
paint like Claude, I could admire ‘the witchery of the soft blue
sky’ as I walked out, and was satisfied with the pleasure it gave me.
If I was dull, it gave me little concern: if I was lively, I indulged
my spirits. I wished well to the world, and believed as favourably
of it as I could. I was like a stranger in a foreign land, at which
I looked with wonder, curiosity, and delight, without expecting to
be an object of attention in return. I had no relations to the state,
no duty to perform, no ties to bind me to others: I had neither
friend nor mistress, wife or child. I lived in a world of contemplation,
and not of action.</p>

<p class='c013'>This sort of dreaming existence is the best. He who quits it to
go in search of realities, generally barters repose for repeated disappointments
and vain regrets. His time, thoughts, and feelings
are no longer at his own disposal. From that instant he does not
survey the objects of nature as they are in themselves, but looks
asquint at them to see whether he cannot make them the instruments
of his ambition, interest, or pleasure; for a candid, undesigning,
undisguised simplicity of character, his views become jaundiced,
sinister, and double: he takes no farther interest in the great changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of the world but as he has a paltry share in producing them: instead
of opening his senses, his understanding, and his heart to the resplendent
fabric of the universe, he holds a crooked mirror before
his face, in which he may admire his own person and pretensions,
and just glance his eye aside to see whether others are not admiring
him too. He no more exists in the impression which ‘the fair
variety of things’ makes upon him, softened and subdued by habitual
contemplation, but in the feverish sense of his own upstart self-importance.
By aiming to fix, he is become the slave of opinion.
He is a tool, a part of a machine that never stands still, and is sick
and giddy with the ceaseless motion. He has no satisfaction but
in the reflection of his own image in the public gaze, but in the
repetition of his own name in the public ear. He himself is mixed
up with, and spoils every thing. I wonder Buonaparte was not
tired of the N.N.’s stuck all over the Louvre and throughout
France. Goldsmith (as we all know), when in Holland, went out
into a balcony with some handsome Englishwomen, and on their
being applauded by the spectators, turned round, and said peevishly—‘There
are places where I also am admired.’ He could not give
the craving appetite of an author’s vanity one day’s respite. I have
seen a celebrated talker of our own time turn pale and go out of
the room when a showy-looking girl has come into it, who for
a moment divided the attention of his hearers. Infinite are the
mortifications of the bare attempt to emerge from obscurity; numberless
the failures; and greater and more galling still the vicissitudes
and tormenting accompaniments of success—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>—‘Whose top to climb</div>
      <div class='line'>Is certain falling, or so slippery, that</div>
      <div class='line'>The fear’s as bad as falling.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>‘Would to God,’ exclaimed Oliver Cromwell, when he was at
any time thwarted by the Parliament, ‘that I had remained by my
wood-side to tend a flock of sheep, rather than have been thrust on
such a government as this!’ When Buonaparte got into his carriage
to proceed on his Russian expedition, carelessly twirling his glove,
and singing the air—‘Malbrook to the wars is going’—he did not
think of the tumble he has got since, the shock of which no one
could have stood but himself. We see and hear chiefly of the
favourites of Fortune and the Muse, of great generals, of first-rate
actors, of celebrated poets. These are at the head; we are struck
with the glittering eminence on which they stand, and long to set out
on the same tempting career:—not thinking how many discontented
half-pay lieutenants are in vain seeking promotion all their lives, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>obliged to put up with ‘the insolence of office, and the spurns which
patient merit of the unworthy takes;’ how many half-starved
strolling-players are doomed to penury and tattered robes in country-places,
dreaming to the last of a London engagement; how many
wretched daubers shiver and shake in the ague-fit of alternate hopes
and fears, waste and pine away in the atrophy of genius, or else turn
drawing-masters, picture-cleaners, or newspaper critics; how many
hapless poets have sighed out their souls to the Muse in vain, without
ever getting their effusions farther known than the Poet’s-Corner of
a country newspaper, and looked and looked with grudging, wistful
eyes at the envious horizon that bounded their provincial fame!
Suppose an actor, for instance, ‘after the heart-aches and the
thousand natural pangs that flesh is heir to,’ <em>does</em> get at the top of his
profession, he can no longer bear a rival near the throne; to be second
or only equal to another, is to be nothing: he starts at the prospect
of a successor, and retains the mimic sceptre with a convulsive grasp:
perhaps as he is about to seize the first place which he has long had
in his eye, an unsuspected competitor steps in before him, and carries
off the prize, leaving him to commence his irksome toil again: he is
in a state of alarm at every appearance or rumour of the appearance of
a new actor: ‘a mouse that takes up its lodging in a cat’s ear’<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> has
a mansion of peace to him: he dreads every hint of an objection, and
least of all can forgive praise mingled with censure: to doubt is to
insult, to discriminate is to degrade: he dare hardly look into a
criticism unless some one has <em>tasted</em> it for him, to see that there is no
offence in it: if he does not draw crowded houses every night, he
can neither eat nor sleep; or if all these terrible inflictions are
removed, and he can ‘eat his meal in peace,’ he then becomes
surfeited with applause and dissatisfied with his profession: he wants
to be something else, to be distinguished as an author, a collector, a
classical scholar, a man of sense and information, and weighs every
word he utters, and half retracts it before he utters it, lest if he were
to make the smallest slip of the tongue, it should get buzzed abroad
that <em>Mr. — was only clever as an actor</em>! If ever there was a man
who did not derive more pain than pleasure from his vanity, that
man, says Rousseau, was no other than a fool. A country-gentleman
near Taunton spent his whole life in making some hundreds of
wretched copies of second-rate pictures, which were bought up at his
death by a neighbouring Baronet, to whom</p>

was carried off by a Bristol picture-dealer for three guineas, while
the muddled copies of the owner of the mansion (with the frames)
fetched thirty, forty, sixty, a hundred ducats a piece. A friend of
mine found a very fine Canaletti in a state of strange disfigurement,
with the upper part of the sky smeared over and fantastically
variegated with English clouds; and on enquiring of the person to
whom it belonged whether something had not been done to it,
received for answer ‘that a gentleman, a great artist in the neighbourhood,
had retouched some parts of it.’ What infatuation! Yet
this candidate for the honours of the pencil might probably have
made a jovial fox-hunter or respectable justice of the peace, if he
could only have stuck to what nature and fortune intended him for.
Miss — can by no means be persuaded to quit the boards of the
theatre at —, a little country town in the West of England. Her
salary has been abridged, her person ridiculed, her acting laughed at;
nothing will serve—she is determined to be an actress, and scorns
to return to her former business as a milliner. Shall I go on?
An actor in the same company was visited by the apothecary of
the place in an ague-fit, who, on asking his landlady as to his
way of life, was told that the poor gentleman was very quiet and
gave little trouble, that he generally had a plate of mashed potatoes
for his dinner, and lay in bed most of his time, repeating his
part. A young couple, every way amiable and deserving, were to
have been married, and a benefit-play was bespoke by the officers
of the regiment quartered there, to defray the expense of a license
and of the wedding-ring, but the profits of the night did not
amount to the necessary sum, and they have, I fear, ‘virgined
it e’er since!’ Oh for the pencil of Hogarth or Wilkie to give
a view of the comic strength of the company at —, drawn
up in battle-array in the Clandestine Marriage, with a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’œil</span></i>
of the pit, boxes, and gallery, to cure for ever the love of the <em>ideal</em>,
and the desire to shine and make holiday in the eyes of others,
instead of retiring within ourselves and keeping our wishes and our
thoughts at home!</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in the common affairs of life, in love, friendship, and
marriage, how little security have we when we trust our happiness in
the hands of others! Most of the friends I have seen have turned
out the bitterest enemies, or cold, uncomfortable acquaintance. Old
companions are like meats served up too often that lose their relish
and their wholesomeness. He who looks at beauty to admire, to
adore it, who reads of its wondrous power in novels, in poems, or in
plays, is not unwise: but let no man fall in love, for from that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>moment he is ‘the baby of a girl.’ I like very well to repeat such

<p class='c013'>Sweet verse embalms the spirit of sour misanthropy: but woe
betide the ignoble prose-writer who should thus dare to compare notes
with the world, or tax it roundly with imposture.</p>

<p class='c013'>If I had sufficient provocation to rail at the public, as Ben Jonson
did at the audience in the Prologues to his plays, I think I should do
it in good set terms, nearly as follows. There is not a more mean,
stupid, dastardly, pitiful, selfish, spiteful, envious, ungrateful animal
than the Public. It is the greatest of cowards, for it is afraid of
itself. From its unwieldy, overgrown dimensions, it dreads the least
opposition to it, and shakes like isinglass at the touch of a finger.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>It starts at its own shadow, like the man in the Hartz mountains, and
trembles at the mention of its own name. It has a lion’s mouth, the
heart of a hare, with ears erect and sleepless eyes. It stands
‘listening its fears.’ It is so in awe of its own opinion, that it never
dares to form any, but catches up the first idle rumour, lest it should
be behind-hand in its judgment, and echoes it till it is deafened with
the sound of its own voice. The idea of what the public will think
prevents the public from ever thinking at all, and acts as a spell on
the exercise of private judgment, so that in short the public ear is at
the mercy of the first impudent pretender who chooses to fill it with
noisy assertions, or false surmises, or secret whispers. What is said
by one is heard by all; the supposition that a thing is known to all
the world makes all the world believe it, and the hollow repetition of a
vague report drowns the ‘still, small voice’ of reason. We may
believe or know that what is said is not true: but we know or fancy
that others believe it—we dare not contradict or are too indolent to
dispute with them, and therefore give up our internal, and, as we
think, our solitary conviction to a sound without substance, without
proof, and often without meaning. Nay more, we may believe and
know not only that a thing is false, but that others believe and know
it to be so, that they are quite as much in the secret of the imposture
as we are, that they see the puppets at work, the nature of the
machinery, and yet if any one has the art or power to get the management
of it, he shall keep possession of the public ear by virtue of a
cant-phrase or nickname; and, by dint of effrontery and perseverance,
make all the world believe and repeat what all the world know to be
false. The ear is quicker than the judgment. We know that
certain things are said; by that circumstance alone we know that
they produce a certain effect on the imagination of others, and we
conform to their prejudices by mechanical sympathy, and for want of
sufficient spirit to differ with them. So far then is public opinion
from resting on a broad and solid basis, as the aggregate of thought
and feeling in a community, that it is slight and shallow and variable
to the last degree—the bubble of the moment—so that we may safely
say the public is the dupe of public opinion, not its parent. The
public is pusillanimous and cowardly, because it is weak. It knows
itself to be a great dunce, and that it has no opinions but upon suggestion.
Yet it is unwilling to appear in leading-strings, and would
have it thought that its decisions are as wise as they are weighty.
It is hasty in taking up its favourites, more hasty in laying them
aside, lest it should be supposed deficient in sagacity in either case.
It is generally divided into two strong parties, each of which will
allow neither common sense nor common honesty to the other side.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>It reads the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews, and believes them
both—or if there is a doubt, malice turns the scale. Taylor and
Hessey told me that they had sold nearly two editions of the
Characters of Shakespear’s Plays in about three months, but that
after the Quarterly Review of them came out, they never sold
another copy. The public, enlightened as they are, must have
known the meaning of that attack as well as those who made it. It
was not ignorance then but cowardice that led them to give up their
own opinion. A crew of mischievous critics at Edinburgh having
fixed the epithet of the <em>Cockney School</em> to one or two writers born in
the metropolis, all the people in London became afraid of looking
into their works, lest they too should be convicted of cockneyism.
Oh brave public! This epithet proved too much for one of the
writers in question, and stuck like a barbed arrow in his heart.

<p class='c015'>It reads, it admires, it extols only because it is the fashion, not from
any love of the subject or the man. It cries you up or runs you
down out of mere caprice and levity. If you have pleased it, it is
jealous of its own involuntary acknowledgment of merit, and seizes
the first opportunity, the first shabby pretext, to pick a quarrel with
you, and be quits once more. Every petty caviller is erected into a
judge, every tale-bearer is implicitly believed. Every little low
paltry creature that gaped and wondered only because others did so,
is glad to find you (as he thinks) on a level with himself. An
author is not then, after all, a being of another order. Public admiration
is forced, and goes against the grain. Public obloquy is
cordial and sincere: every individual feels his own importance in it.
They give you up bound hand and foot into the power of your
accusers. To attempt to defend yourself is a high crime and misdemeanour,
a contempt of court, an extreme piece of impertinence.
Or, if you prove every charge unfounded, they never think of retracting
their error, or making you amends. It would be a compromise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of their dignity; they consider themselves as the party
injured, and resent your innocence as an imputation on their judgment.
The celebrated Bub Doddington, when out of favour at court, said
‘he would not <em>justify</em> before his sovereign: it was for Majesty to be
displeased, and for him to believe himself in the wrong!’ The
public are not quite so modest. People already begin to talk of the
Scotch Novels as overrated. How then can common authors be
supposed to keep their heads long above water? As a general rule,
all those who live by the public starve, and are made a bye-word and
a standing jest into the bargain. Posterity is no better (not a bit
more enlightened or more liberal), except that you are no longer in
their power, and that the voice of common fame saves them the
trouble of deciding on your claims. The public now are the posterity
of Milton and Shakespear. Our posterity will be the living public
of a future generation. When a man is dead, they put money in his
coffin, erect monuments to his memory, and celebrate the anniversary
of his birthday in set speeches. Would they take any notice of him
if he were living? No!—I was complaining of this to a Scotchman
who had been attending a dinner and a subscription to raise a
monument to Burns. He replied, he would sooner subscribe twenty
pounds to his monument than have given it him while living; so that
if the poet were to come to life again, he would treat him just as he
was treated in fact. This was an honest Scotchman. What <em>he</em>
said, the rest would do.</p>

<p class='c013'>Enough: my soul, turn from them, and let me try to regain the
obscurity and quiet that I love, ‘far from the madding strife,’ in
some sequestered corner of my own, or in some far-distant land!
In the latter case, I might carry with me as a consolation the passage
in Bolingbroke’s Reflections on Exile, in which he describes in
glowing colours the resources which a man may always find within
himself, and of which the world cannot deprive him.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Believe me, the providence of God has established such an order
in the world, that of all which belongs to us, the least valuable parts
can alone fall under the will of others. Whatever is best is safest;
lies out of the reach of human power; can neither be given nor taken
away. Such is this great and beautiful work of nature, the world.
Such is the mind of man, which contemplates and admires the world
whereof it makes the noblest part. These are inseparably ours, and
as long as we remain in one we shall enjoy the other. Let us march
therefore intrepidly wherever we are led by the course of human
accidents. Wherever they lead us, on what coast soever we are
thrown by them, we shall not find ourselves absolutely strangers.
We shall feel the same revolution of seasons, and the same sun and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>moon<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a> will guide the course of our year. The same azure vault,
bespangled with stars, will be every where spread over our heads.
There is no part of the world from whence we may not admire those
planets which roll, like ours, in different orbits round the same central
sun; from whence we may not discover an object still more
stupendous, that army of fixed stars hung up in the immense space of
the universe, innumerable suns whose beams enlighten and cherish the
unknown worlds which roll around them; and whilst I am ravished
by such contemplations as these, whilst my soul is thus raised up to
heaven, imports me little what ground I tread upon.’</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XI<br /> <span class='small'>ON THOUGHT AND ACTION</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>Those persons who are much accustomed to abstract contemplation
are generally unfitted for active pursuits, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>. I myself
am sufficiently decided and dogmatical in my opinions, and yet in
action I am as imbecile as a woman or a child. I cannot set about
the most indifferent thing without twenty efforts, and had rather
write one of these Essays than have to seal a letter. In trying to
throw a hat or a book upon a table, I miss it; it just reaches the
edge and falls back again, and instead of doing what I mean to perform,
I do what I intend to avoid. Thought depends on the habitual
exercise of the speculative faculties; action on the determination of
the will. The one assigns reasons for things, the other puts causes
into act. Abraham Tucker relates of a friend of his, an old special
pleader, that once coming out of his chambers in the Temple with
him to take a walk, he hesitated at the bottom of the stairs which
way to go—proposed different directions, to Charing Cross, to St.
Paul’s,—found some objection to them all, and at last turned back
for want of a casting motive to incline the scale. Tucker gives this
as an instance of professional indecision, or of that temper of mind
which having been long used to weigh the reasons for things with
scrupulous exactness, could not come to any conclusion at all on the
spur of the occasion, or without some grave distinction to justify its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>choice. Louvet, in his Narrative, tells us, that when several of the
Brissotin party were collected at the house of Barbaroux (I think it
was) ready to effect their escape from the power of Robespierre, one
of them going to the window and finding a shower of rain coming
on, seriously advised their stopping till the next morning, for that the
emissaries of government would not think of coming in search of them
in such bad weather. Some of them deliberated on this wise proposal,
and were nearly taken. Such is the effeminacy of the
speculative and philosophical temperament, compared with the promptness
and vigour of the practical! It is on such unequal terms that
the refined and romantic speculators on possible good and evil contend
with their strong-nerved, remorseless adversaries, and we see the
result. Reasoners in general are undecided, wavering, and sceptical,
or yield at last to the weakest motive, as most congenial to their
feeble habit of soul.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Some men are mere machines. They are put in a go-cart of
business, and are harnessed to a profession—yoked to fortune’s
wheels. They plod on, and succeed. Their affairs conduct them,
not they their affairs. All they have to do is to let things take their
course, and not go out of the beaten road. A man may carry on the
business of farming on the same spot and principle that his ancestors
have done for many generations before him without any extraordinary
share of capacity: the proof is, it is done every day in every county
and parish in the kingdom. All that is necessary is that he should
not pretend to be wiser than his neighbours. If he has a grain more
wit or penetration than they, if his vanity gets the start of his avarice
only half a neck, if he has ever thought or read any thing upon the
subject, it will most probably be the ruin of him. He will turn
theoretical or experimental farmer, and no more need be said.
Mr. Cobbett, who is a sufficiently shrewd and practical man, with
an eye also to the main chance, had got some notions in his head
(from Tull’s Husbandry) about the method of sowing turnips, to
which he would have sacrificed not only his estate at Botley, but his
native county of Hampshire itself, sooner than give up an inch of
his argument. ‘Tut! will you baulk a man in the career of his
humour?’ Therefore, that a man may not be ruined by his humours,
he should be too dull and phlegmatic to have any: he must have ‘no
figures nor no fantasies which busy thought draws in the brains of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>men.’ The fact is, that the ingenuity or judgment of no one man is
equal to that of the world at large, which is the fruit of the experience
and ability of all mankind. Even where a man is right in a
particular notion, he will be apt to overrate the importance of his
discovery, to the detriment of his affairs. Action requires co-operation,
but in general if you set your face against custom, people will
set their faces against you. They cannot tell whether you are right
or wrong, but they know that you are guilty of a pragmatical
assumption of superiority over them, which they do not like.
There is no doubt that if a person two hundred years ago had
foreseen and attempted to put in practice the most approved and
successful methods of cultivation now in use, it would have been a
death-blow to his credit and fortune. So that though the experiments
and improvements of private individuals from time to time gradually
go to enrich the public stock of information and reform the general
practice, they are mostly the ruin of the person who makes them,
because he takes a part for the whole, and lays more stress upon the
single point in which he has found others in the wrong, than on all
the rest in which they are substantially and prescriptively in the right.
The great requisite, it should appear then, for the prosperous management
of ordinary business, is the want of imagination, or of any ideas
but those of custom and interest on the narrowest scale:—and as the
affairs of the world are necessarily carried on by the common run of
its inhabitants, it seems a wise dispensation of Providence that it
should be so. If no one could rent a piece of glebeland without a
genius for mechanical inventions, or stand behind a counter without
a large benevolence of soul, what would become of the commercial
and agricultural interests of this great (and once flourishing) country?
I would not be understood as saying that there is not what may be
called <em>a genius for business</em>, an extraordinary capacity for affairs,
quickness and comprehension united, an insight into character, an
acquaintance with a number of particular circumstances, a variety of
expedients, a tact for finding out what will do: I grant all this (in
Liverpool and Manchester they would persuade you that your
merchant and manufacturer is your only gentleman and scholar)—but
still, making every allowance for the difference between the liberal
trader and the sneaking shopkeeper, I doubt whether the most
surprising success is to be accounted for from any such unusual
attainments, or whether a man’s making half a million of money
is a proof of his capacity for thought in general. It is much oftener
owing to views and wishes bounded but constantly directed to one
particular object. To succeed, a man should aim only at success.
The child of Fortune should resign himself into the hands of Fortune.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>A plotting head frequently overreaches itself: a mind confident of
its resources and calculating powers enters on critical speculations,
which, in a game depending so much on chance and unforeseen events,
and not entirely on intellectual skill, turn the odds greatly against any
one in the long run. The rule of business is to take what you can get,
and keep what you have got: or an eagerness in seizing every opportunity
that offers for promoting your own interest, and a plodding
persevering industry in making the most of the advantages you have
already obtained, are the most effectual as well as safest ingredients
in the composition of the mercantile character. The world is a
book in which the <cite>Chapter of Accidents</cite> is none of the least considerable;
or it is a machine that must be left, in a great measure, to turn
itself. The most that a worldly-minded man can do is, to stand at
the receipt of custom, and be constantly on the look-out for windfalls.
The true devotee in this way waits for the revelations of Fortune as
the poet waits for the inspiration of the Muse, and does not rashly
anticipate her favours. He must be neither capricious nor wilful. I
have known people untrammelled in the ways of business, but with so
intense an apprehension of their own interest, that they would grasp
at the slightest possibility of gain as a certainty, and were led into as
many mistakes by an over-griping usurious disposition as they could
have been by the most thoughtless extravagance.—We hear a great
outcry about the want of judgment in men of genius. It is not a
want of judgment, but an excess of other things. They err knowingly,
and are wilfully blind. The understanding is out of the question.
The profound judgment which soberer people pique themselves upon
is in truth a want of passion and imagination. Give them an interest
in any thing, a sudden fancy, a bait for their favourite foible, and who
so besotted as they? Stir their feelings, and farewel to their
prudence! The understanding operates as a motive to action only
in the silence of the passions. I have heard people of a sanguine
temperament reproached with betting according to their wishes,
instead of their opinion who should win: and I have seen those who
reproached them do the very same thing the instant their own vanity
or prejudices were concerned. The most mechanical people, once
thrown off their balance, are the most extravagant and fantastical.
What passion is there so unmeaning and irrational as avarice itself?
The Dutch went mad for tulips, and — — for love!—To
return to what was said a little way back, a question might be started,
whether, as thought relates to the whole circumference of things and
interests, and business is confined to a very small part of them, viz.
to a knowledge of a man’s own affairs and the making of his own
fortune, whether a talent for the latter will not generally exist in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>proportion to the narrowness and grossness of his ideas, nothing drawing
his attention out of his own sphere, or giving him an interest
except in those things which he can realise and bring home to himself
in the most undoubted shape? To the man of business all the world
is a Fable but the Stock-Exchange: to the money-getter nothing has
a real existence that he cannot convert into a tangible feeling, that he
does not recognise as property, that he cannot ‘measure with a two-foot
rule or count upon ten fingers.’ The want of thought, of
imagination, drives the practical man upon immediate realities: to
the poet or philosopher all is real and interesting that is true or
possible, that can reach in its consequences to others, or be made a
subject of curious speculation to himself!</p>

<p class='c013'>But is it right, then, to judge of action by the quantity of thought
implied in it, any more than it would be to condemn a life of contemplation
for being inactive? Or, has not every thing a source and
principle of its own, to which we should refer it, and not to the
principles of other things? He who succeeds in any pursuit in which
others fail, may be presumed to have qualities of some sort or other
which they are without. If he has not brilliant wit, he may have
solid sense; if he has not subtlety of understanding, he may have
energy and firmness of purpose: if he has only a few advantages, he
may have modesty and prudence to make the most of what he
possesses. Propriety is one great matter in the conduct of life;
which, though like a graceful carriage of the body it is neither
definable nor striking at first sight, is the result of finely balanced
feelings, and lends a secret strength and charm to the whole
character.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are more ways than one in which the various faculties of the
mind may unfold themselves. Neither words, nor ideas reducible to
words, constitute the utmost limit of human capacity. Man is not
a merely talking nor a merely reasoning animal. Let us then take
him as he is, instead of ‘curtailing him of nature’s fair proportions’
to suit our previous notions. Doubtless, there are great characters
both in active and contemplative life. There have been heroes as
well as sages, legislators and founders of religion, historians and able
statesmen and generals, inventors of useful arts and instruments, and
explorers of undiscovered countries, as well as writers and readers of
books. It will not do to set all these aside under any fastidious or
pedantic distinction. Comparisons are odious, because they are impertinent,
and lead only to the discovery of defects by making one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>thing the standard of another which has no relation to it. If, as some
one proposed, we were to institute an inquiry, ‘Which was the
greatest man, Milton or Cromwell, Buonaparte or Rubens?’—we
should have all the authors and artists on one side, and all the
military men and the whole diplomatic body on the other, who would
set to work with all their might to pull in pieces the idol of the other
party, and the longer the dispute continued, the more would each
grow dissatisfied with his favourite, though determined to allow no
merit to any one else. The mind is not well competent to take in
the full impression of more than one style of excellence or one extraordinary
character at once; contradictory claims puzzle and stupefy
it; and however admirable any individual may be in himself, and
unrivalled in his particular way, yet if we try him by others in a
totally opposite class, that is, if we consider not what he was but
what he was not, he will be found to be nothing. We do not reckon
up the excellences on either side, for then these would satisfy the
mind and put an end to the comparison: we have no way of exclusively
setting up our favourite but by running down his supposed
rival; and for the gorgeous hues of Rubens, the lofty conceptions of
Milton, the deep policy and cautious daring of Cromwell, or the
dazzling exploits and fatal ambition of the modern chieftain, the poet
is transformed into a pedant, the artist sinks into a mechanic, the
politician turns out no better than a knave, and the hero is exalted
into a madman. It is as easy to get the start of our antagonist in
argument by frivolous and vexatious objections to one side of the
question, as it is difficult to do full and heaped justice to the other.
If I am asked which is the greatest of those who have been the
greatest in different ways, I answer the one that we happen to be
thinking of at the time, for while that is the case, we can conceive
of nothing higher. If there is a propensity in the vulgar to admire
the achievements of personal prowess or instances of fortunate
enterprise too much, it cannot be denied that those who have to
weigh out and dispense the meed of fame in books, have been too
much disposed, by a natural bias, to confine all merit and talent to the
productions of the pen, or at least to those works which, being
artificial or abstract representations of things, are transmitted to
posterity, and cried up as models in their kind. This, though unavoidable,
is hardly just. Actions pass away and are forgotten, or
are only discernible in their effects: conquerors, statesmen, and kings
live but by their names stamped on the page of history. Hume says
rightly that more people think about Virgil and Homer (and that
continually) than ever trouble their heads about Cæsar or Alexander.
In fact, poets are a longer-lived race than heroes: they breathe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>more of the air of immortality. They survive more entire in their
thoughts and acts. We have all that Virgil or Homer did, as much
as if we had lived at the same time with them: we can hold their
works in our hands, or lay them on our pillows, or put them to our
lips. Scarcely a trace of what the others did is left upon the earth,
so as to be visible to common eyes. The one, the dead authors, are
living men, still breathing and moving in their writings. The others,
the conquerors of the world, are but the ashes in an urn. The
sympathy (so to speak) between thought and thought is more
intimate and vital than that between thought and action. Thought
is linked to thought as flame kindles into flame: the tribute of
admiration to the <em>manes</em> of departed heroism is like burning incense
in a marble monument. Words, ideas, feelings, with the progress of
time harden into substances: things, bodies, actions, moulder away,
or melt into a sound, into thin air! Yet though the Schoolmen in
the middle ages disputed more about the texts of Aristotle than the
battle of Arbela, perhaps Alexander’s Generals in his life-time admired
his pupil as much, and liked him better. For not only a man’s
actions are effaced and vanish with him; his virtues and generous
qualities die with him also:—his intellect only is immortal, and
bequeathed unimpaired to posterity. Words are the only things that
last for ever.</p>

<p class='c013'>If however the empire of words and general knowledge is more
durable in proportion as it is abstracted and attenuated, it is less
immediate and dazzling: if authors are as good after they are dead
as when they were living, while living they might as well be dead:
and moreover with respect to actual ability, to write a book is not
the only proof of taste, sense, or spirit, as pedants would have us
suppose. To do any thing well, to paint a picture, to fight a battle,
to make a plough or a threshing-machine, requires, one would think,
as much skill and judgment as to talk about or write a description of
it when done. Words are universal, intelligible signs, but they are
not the only real, existing things. Did not Julius Cæsar shew
himself as much of a man in conducting his campaigns as in composing
his Commentaries? Or was the Retreat of the Ten Thousand
under Xenophon, or his work of that name, the most consummate
performance? Or would not Lovelace, supposing him to have
existed and to have conceived and executed all his fine stratagems
on the spur of the occasion, have been as clever a fellow as Richardson,
who invented them in cold blood? If to conceive and describe
an heroic character is the height of a literary ambition, we can
hardly make it out that to be and to do all that the wit of man can
feign, is nothing. To use means to ends, to set causes in motion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>to wield the machine of society, to subject the wills of others to
your own, to manage abler men than yourself by means of that which
is stronger in them than their wisdom, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> their weakness and their
folly, to calculate the resistance of ignorance and prejudice to your
designs, and by obviating to turn them to account, to foresee a long,
obscure, and complicated train of events, of chances and openings of
success, to unwind the web of others’ policy, and weave your own
out of it, to judge of the effects of things not in the abstract but
with reference to all their bearings, ramifications and impediments,
to understand character thoroughly, to see latent talent or lurking
treachery, to know mankind for what they are, and use them as they
deserve, to have a purpose steadily in view and to effect it after
removing every obstacle, to master others and be true to yourself,
asks power and knowledge, both nerves and brain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the sort of talent that may be shewn, and that has been
possessed by the great leaders on the stage of the world. To accomplish
great things argues, I imagine, great resolution: to design great
things implies no common mind. Ambition is in some sort genius.
Though I would rather wear out my life in arguing a broad speculative
question than in caballing for the election to a wardmote, or
canvassing for votes in a rotten borough, yet I should think that
the loftiest Epicurean philosopher might descend from his punctilio
to identify himself with the support of a great principle, or to prop
a falling state. This is what the legislators and founders of empire
did of old; and the permanence of their institutions shewed the
depth of the principles from which they emanated. A tragic poem
is not the worse for acting well: if it will not bear this test, it
savours of effeminacy. Well-digested schemes will stand the touchstone
of experience. Great thoughts reduced to practice become
great acts. Again, great acts grow out of great occasions, and great
occasions spring from great principles, working changes in society,
and tearing it up by the roots. But still I conceive that a genius for
action depends essentially on the strength of the will rather than on
that of the understanding; that the long-headed calculation of causes
and consequences arises from the energy of the first cause, which is
the will, setting others in motion and prepared to anticipate the
results; that its sagacity is activity delighting in meeting difficulties
and adventures more than half way, and its wisdom courage not to
shrink from danger, but to redouble its efforts with opposition. Its
humanity, if it has much, is magnanimity to spare the vanquished,
exulting in power but not prone to mischief, with good sense enough
to be aware of the instability of fortune, and with some regard to
reputation. What may serve as a criterion to try this question by is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the following consideration, that we sometimes find as remarkable a
deficiency of the speculative faculty coupled with great strength of
will and consequent success in active life, as we do a want of voluntary
power and total incapacity for business, frequently joined to the
highest mental qualifications. In some cases it will happen that ‘to
be wise, is to be obstinate.’ If you are deaf to reason but stick to
your own purposes, you will tire others out, and bring them over
to your way of thinking. Self-will and blind prejudice are the best
defence of actual power and exclusive advantages. The forehead of
the late king was not remarkable for the character of intellect, but the
lower part of his face was expressive of strong passions and fixed
resolution. Charles Fox had an animated, intelligent eye, and
brilliant, elastic forehead (with a nose indicating fine taste), but the
lower features were weak, unsettled, fluctuating, and without <em>purchase</em>—it
was in them the Whigs were defeated. What a fine iron binding
Buonaparte had round his face, as if it had been cased in steel! What
sensibility about the mouth! What watchful penetration in the eye!
What a smooth, unruffled forehead! Mr. Pitt, with little sunken
eyes, had a high, retreating forehead, and a nose expressing pride and
aspiring self-opinion: it was on that (with submission) that he suspended
the decisions of the House of Commons, and dangled the
Opposition as he pleased. Lord Castlereagh is a man rather deficient
than redundant in words and topics. He is not (any more than St.
Augustine was, in the opinion of La Fontaine) so great a wit as
Rabelais, nor is he so great a philosopher as Aristotle: but he has
that in him which is not to be trifled with. He has a noble mask of
a face (not well filled up in the expression, which is relaxed and
dormant), with a fine person and manner. On the strength of these
he hazards his speeches in the House. He has also a knowledge of
mankind, and of the composition of the House. He takes a thrust
which he cannot parry on his shield—is ‘all tranquillity and smiles’
under a volley of abuse, sees when to pay a compliment to a wavering
antagonist, soothes the melting mood of his hearers, or gets up a
speech full of indignation, and knows how to bestow his attentions on
that great public body, whether he wheedles or bullies, so as to bring
it to compliance. With a long reach of undefined purposes (the
result of a temper too indolent for thought, too violent for repose) he
has equal perseverance and pliancy in bringing his objects to pass.
I would rather be Lord Castlereagh, as far as a sense of power is
concerned (principle is out of the question), than such a man as Mr.
Canning, who is a mere fluent sophist, and never knows the limits
of discretion, or the effect which will be produced by what he
says, except as far as florid common-places may be depended on.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Buonaparte is referred by Mr. Coleridge to the class of active rather
than of intellectual characters: and Cowley has left an invidious but
splendid eulogy on Oliver Cromwell, which sets out on much the
same principle. ‘What,’ he says, ‘can be more extraordinary, than
that a person of mean birth, no fortune, no eminent qualities of body,
which have sometimes, or of mind, which have often raised men to
the highest dignities, should have the courage to attempt, and the
happiness to succeed in, so improbable a design, as the destruction of
one of the most ancient and most solidly-founded monarchies upon the
earth? That he should have the power or boldness to put his prince
and master to an open and infamous death; to banish that numerous
and strongly-allied family; to do all this under the name and wages
of a Parliament; to trample upon them too as he pleased, and spurn
them out of doors when he grew weary of them; to raise up
a new and unheard-of monster out of their ashes; to stifle that
in the very infancy, and set up himself above all things that ever
were called sovereign in England; to oppress all his enemies by
arms, and all his friends afterwards by artifice; to serve all parties
patiently for a while, and to command them victoriously at last; to
over-run each corner of the three nations, and overcome with equal
facility both the riches of the south and the poverty of the north; to
be feared and courted by all foreign princes, and adopted a brother to
the Gods of the earth; to call together Parliaments with a word of
his pen, and scatter them again with the breath of his mouth; to be
humbly and daily petitioned that he would please to be hired, at the
rate of two millions a year, to be the master of those who had hired
him before to be their servant; to have the estates and lives of three
kingdoms as much at his disposal, as was the little inheritance of his
father, and to be as noble and liberal in the spending of them; and
lastly, (for there is no end of all the particular of his glory) to bequeath
all this with one word to his posterity; to die with peace at
home, and triumph abroad; to be buried among kings, and with more
than regal solemnity; and to leave a name behind him, not to be
extinguished but with the whole world; which as it is now too little
for his praises, so might have been too [narrow] for his conquests, if
the short line of his human life could have been stretched out to the
extent of his immortal designs!’</p>

<p class='c013'>Cromwell was a bad speaker and a worse writer. Milton wrote
his dispatches for him in elegant and erudite Latin: and the pen of
the one, like the sword of the other, was ‘sharp and sweet.’ We
have not that union in modern times of the heroic and literary character
which was common among the ancients. Julius Cæsar and
Xenophon recorded their own acts with equal clearness of style and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>modesty of temper. The Duke of Wellington (worse off than
Cromwell) is obliged to get Mr. Mudford to write the History of
his Life. Sophocles, Æschylus, and Socrates, were distinguished for
their military prowess among their contemporaries, though now only
remembered for what they did in poetry and philosophy. Cicero and
Demosthenes, the two greatest orators of antiquity, appear to have
been cowards: Nor does Horace seem to give a very favourable
picture of his martial achievements. But in general there was not
that division in the labours of the mind and body among the Greeks
and Romans that has been introduced among us either by the progress
of civilisation or by a greater slowness and inaptitude of parts. The
French, for instance, appear to unite a number of accomplishments,
the literary character and the man of the world, better than we do.
Among us, a scholar is almost another name for a pedant or a clown:
it is not so with them. Their philosophers and wits went into the
world, and mingled in the society of the fair. Of this there needs no
other proof than the spirited print of most of the great names in
French literature, to whom Moliere is reading a comedy in the presence
of the celebrated Ninon de l’Enclos. D’Alembert, one of the
first mathematicians of his age, was a wit, a man of gallantry and
letters. With us a learned man is absorbed in himself and some
particular study, and minds nothing else. There is something ascetic
and impracticable in his very constitution, and he answers to the
description of the Monk in Spenser—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Perhaps the superior importance attached to the institutions of religion,
as well as the more abstracted and visionary nature of its objects, has
led (as a general result) to a wider separation between thought and
action in modern times.—Ambition is of a higher and more heroic
strain than avarice. Its objects are nobler, and the means by which
it attains its ends less mechanical.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The incentive to ambition is the love of power; the spur to avarice
is either the fear of poverty, or a strong desire of self-indulgence.
The amassers of fortunes seem divided into two opposite classes, lean,
penurious-looking mortals, or jolly fellows who are determined to get
possession of, because they want to enjoy, the good things of the world.
The one have famine and a work-house always before their eyes,
the others, in the fulness of their persons and the robustness of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>constitutions, seem to bespeak the reversion of a landed estate, rich acres,
fat beeves, a substantial mansion, costly clothing, a chine and turkey,
choice wines, and all other good things consonant to the wants and
full-fed desires of their bodies. Such men charm fortune by the
sleekness of their aspects and the goodly rotundity of their honest
faces, as the others scare away poverty by their wan, meagre looks.
The last starve themselves into riches by care and carking: the first
eat, drink, and sleep their way into the good things of this life. The
greatest number of <em>warm</em> men in the city are good, jolly fellows.
Look at Sir William — —Callipash and callipee are written in his
face: he rolls about his unwieldy bulk in a sea of turtle-soup. How
many haunches of venison does he carry on his back! He is larded
with jobs and contracts; he is stuffed and swelled out with layers of
bank-notes, and invitations to dinner! His face hangs out a flag of
defiance to mischance: the roguish twinkle in his eye with which he
lures half the city and beats Alderman — hollow, is a smile reflected
from heaps of unsunned gold! Nature and Fortune are not so
much at variance as to differ about this fellow. To enjoy the good
the Gods provide us, is to deserve it. Nature meant him for a
Knight, Alderman, and City-Member; and Fortune laughed to see
the goodly person and prospects of the man!<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a>—I am not, from
certain early prejudices, much given to admire the ostentatious marks
of wealth (there are persons enough to admire them without me)—but
I confess, there is something in the look of the old banking-houses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>in Lombard Street, the posterns covered with mud, the doors
opening sullenly and silently, the absence of all pretence, the darkness
and the gloom within, the gleaming of lamps in the day-time,</p>

<p class='c015'>that almost realises the poetical conception of the cave of Mammon in
Spenser, where dust and cobwebs concealed the roofs and pillars of
solid gold, and lifts the mind quite off its ordinary hinges. The
account of the manner in which the founder of Guy’s Hospital
accumulated his immense wealth has always to me something romantic
in it, from the same force of contrast. He was a little shopkeeper,
and out of his savings bought Bibles, and purchased seamen’s tickets in
Queen Anne’s wars, by which he left a fortune of two hundred
thousand pounds. The story suggests the idea of a magician; nor is
there anything in the Arabian Nights that looks more like a fiction.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XII<br /> <span class='small'>ON WILL-MAKING</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>Few things show the human character in a more ridiculous light
than the circumstance of will-making. It is the latest opportunity
we have of exercising the natural perversity of the disposition, and
we take care to make a good use of it. We husband it with jealousy,
put it off as long as we can, and then use every precaution that the
world shall be no gainer by our deaths. This last act of our lives
seldom belies the former tenor of them, for stupidity, caprice, and
unmeaning spite. All that we seem to think of is to manage matters
so (in settling accounts with those who are so unmannerly as to
survive us) as to do as little good, and to plague and disappoint as
many people as possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many persons have a superstition on the subject of making their
last will and testament, and think that when every thing is ready
signed and sealed, there is nothing farther left to delay their
departure. I have heard of an instance of one person who having a
feeling of this kind on his mind, and being teazed into making his
will by those about him, actually fell ill with pure apprehension, and
thought he was going to die in good earnest, but having executed the
deed over-night, awoke, to his great surprise, the next morning,
and found himself as well as ever he was.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a> An elderly gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>possessed of a good estate and the same idle notion, and who found
himself in a dangerous way, was anxious to do this piece of justice to
those who remained behind him, but when it came to the point, his
heart failed him, and his nervous fancies returned in full force:—even
on his death-bed he still held back and was averse to sign what
he looked upon as his own death-warrant, and just at the last gasp,
amidst the anxious looks and silent upbraidings of friends and relatives
that surrounded him, he summoned resolution to hold out his feeble
hand which was guided by others to trace his name, and he fell back—a
corpse! If there is any pressing reason for it, that is, if any
particular person would be relieved from a state of harassing uncertainty,
or materially benefited by their making a will, the old and
infirm (who do not like to be put out of their way) generally make
this an excuse to themselves for putting it off to the very last moment,
probably till it is too late: or where this is sure to make the greatest
number of blank faces, contrive to give their friends the slip, without
signifying their final determination in their favour. Where some
unfortunate individual has been kept long in suspense, who has been
perhaps sought out for that very purpose, and who may be in a great
measure dependent on this as a last resource, it is nearly a certainty
that there will be no will to be found; no trace, no sign to discover
whether the person dying thus intestate ever had any intention of the
sort, or why they relinquished it. This it is to bespeak the thoughts
and imaginations of others for victims after we are dead, as well as
their persons and expectations for hangers-on while we are living.
A celebrated beauty of the middle of the last century, towards its
close sought out a female relative, the friend and companion of her
youth, who had lived during the forty years of their separation in
rather straitened circumstances, and in a situation which admitted of
some alleviations. Twice they met after that long lapse of time—once
her relation visited her in the splendour of a rich old family-mansion,
and once she crossed the country to become an inmate of
the humble dwelling of her early and only remaining friend. What
was this for? Was it to revive the image of her youth in the pale
and careworn face of her friend? Or was it to display the decay of
her charms and recal her long-forgotten triumphs to the memory of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the only person who could bear witness to them? Was it to show
the proud remains of herself to those who remembered or had often
heard what she was—her skin like shrivelled alabaster, her emaciated
features chiseled by nature’s finest hand, her eyes that when a smile
lighted them up, still shone like diamonds, the vermilion hues that
still bloomed among wrinkles? Was it to talk of bone-lace, of the
flounces and brocades of the last century, of race-balls in the year
62, and of the scores of lovers that had died at her feet, and to set
whole counties in a flame again, only with a dream of faded beauty?
Whether it was for this, or whether she meant to leave her friend any
thing (as was indeed expected, all things considered, not without
reason) nobody knows—for she never breathed a syllable on the
subject herself, and died without a will. The accomplished coquet
of twenty, who had pampered hopes only to kill them, who had
kindled rapture with a look and extinguished it with a breath,
could find no better employment at seventy than to revive the
fond recollections and raise up the drooping hopes of her kinswoman
only to let them fall—to rise no more. Such is the delight
we have in trifling with and tantalising the feelings of others
by the exquisite refinements, the studied sleights of love or friendship!</p>

<p class='c013'>Where a property is actually bequeathed, supposing the circumstances
of the case and the usages of society to leave a practical
discretion to the testator, it is most frequently in such portions as can
be of the least service. Where there is much already, much is
given; where much is wanted, little or nothing. Poverty invites a
sort of pity, a miserable dole of assistance; necessity neglect and
scorn; wealth attracts and allures to itself more wealth, by natural
association of ideas, or by that innate love of inequality and injustice,
which is the favourite principle of the imagination. Men like to
collect money into large heaps in their life-time: they like to leave it
in large heaps after they are dead. They grasp it into their own
hands, not to use it for their own good, but to hoard, to lock it up,
to make an object, an idol, and a wonder of it. Do you expect them
to distribute it so as to do others good; that they will like those who
come after them better than themselves; that if they were willing to
pinch and starve themselves, they will not deliberately defraud their
sworn friends and nearest kindred of what would be of the utmost use
to them? No, they will thrust their heaps of gold and silver into the
hands of others (as their proxies) to keep for them untouched, still
increasing, still of no use to any one, but to pamper pride and avarice,
to glitter in the huge, watchful, insatiable eye of fancy, to be deposited
as a new offering at the shrine of Mammon, their God—this is with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>them to put it to its intelligible and proper use, this is fulfilling a
sacred, indispensable duty, this cheers them in the solitude of the
grave, and throws a gleam of satisfaction across the stony eye of
death. But to think of frittering it down, of sinking it in charity, of
throwing it away on the idle claims of humanity, where it would no
longer peer in monumental pomp over their heads; and that too
when on the point of death themselves, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in articulo mortis</span></i>, oh! it
would be madness, waste, extravagance, impiety! Thus worldlings
feel and argue without knowing it; and while they fancy they are
studying their own interest or that of some booby successor, their
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">alter idem</span></i>, are but the dupes and puppets of a favourite idea, a
phantom, a prejudice, that must be kept up somewhere (no matter
where) if it still plays before and haunts their imagination while
they have sense or understanding left—to cling to their darling
follies.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a remarkable instance of this tendency <em>to the heap</em>,
this desire to cultivate an abstract passion for wealth, in a will of
one of the Thellusons some time back. This will went to keep
the greater part of a large property from the use of the natural heirs
and next-of-kin for a length of time, and to let it accumulate at
compound interest in such a way and so long, that it would at last
mount up in value to the purchase-money of a whole county.
The interest accruing from the funded property or the rent of the
lands at certain periods was to be employed to purchase other
estates, other parks and manors in the neighbourhood or farther off,
so that the prospect of the future demesne that was to devolve at
some distant time to the unborn lord of acres, swelled and enlarged
itself, like a sea, circle without circle, vista beyond vista, till the
imagination was staggered, and the mind exhausted. Now here
was a scheme for the accumulation of wealth, and for laying the
foundation of family-aggrandisement purely imaginary, romantic—one
might almost say disinterested. The vagueness, the magnitude,
the remoteness of the object, the resolute sacrifice of all immediate
and gross advantages, clothe it with the privileges of an abstract
idea, so that the project has the air of a fiction or of a story in a
novel. It was an instance of what might be called posthumous
avarice, like the love of posthumous fame. It had little more to
do with selfishness than if the testator had appropriated the same
sums in the same way to build a pyramid, to construct an aqueduct,
to endow an hospital, or effect any other patriotic or merely fantastic
purpose. He wished to heap up a pile of wealth (millions of acres)
in the dim horizon of future years, that could be of no use to him
or to those with whom he was connected by positive and personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>ties, but as a crotchet of the brain, a gew-gaw of the fancy.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Yet
to enable himself to put this scheme in execution, he had perhaps
toiled and watched all his life, denied himself rest, food, pleasure,
liberty, society, and persevered with the patience and self-denial of
a martyr. I have insisted on this point the more, to shew how
much of the imaginary and speculative there is interfused even in
those passions and purposes which have not the good of others for
their object, and how little reason this honest citizen and builder
of castles in the air would have had to treat those who devoted
themselves to the pursuit of fame, to obloquy and persecution for
the sake of truth and liberty, or who sacrificed their lives for their
country in a just cause, as visionaries and enthusiasts, who did not
understand what was properly due to their own interest and the
securing of the main-chance. Man is not the creature of sense
and selfishness, even in those pursuits which grow up out of that
origin, so much as of imagination, custom, passion, whim, and
humour.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have heard of a singular instance of a will made by a person
who was addicted to a habit of lying. He was so notorious for
this propensity (not out of spite or cunning, but as a gratuitous
exercise of invention), that from a child no one could ever believe
a syllable he uttered. From the want of any dependence to be
placed on him, he became the jest and bye-word of the school where
he was brought up. The last act of his life did not disgrace him.
For having gone abroad, and falling into a dangerous decline, he
was advised to return home. He paid all that he was worth for
his passage, went on ship-board, and employed the few remaining
days he had to live in making and executing his will; in which
he bequeathed large estates in different parts of England, money
in the funds, rich jewels, rings, and all kinds of valuables, to his
old friends and acquaintance, who not knowing how far the force
of nature could go, were not for some time convinced that all this
fairy wealth had never had an existence any where but in the idle
coinage of his brain whose whims and projects were no more! The
extreme keeping in this character is only to be accounted for by
supposing such an original constitutional levity as made truth entirely
indifferent to him, and the serious importance attached to it by
others an object of perpetual sport and ridicule!</p>

<p class='c013'>The art of will-making chiefly consists in baffling the importunity
of expectation. I do not so much find fault with this when it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>done as a punishment and oblique satire on servility and selfishness.
It is in that case <em>Diamond cut Diamond</em>—a trial of skill between
the legacy-hunter and the legacy-maker, which shall fool the other.
The cringing toad-eater, the officious tale-bearer, is perhaps well
paid for years of obsequious attendance with a bare mention and a
mourning-ring; nor can I think that Gil Blas’ library was not
quite as much as the coxcombry of his pretensions deserved. There
are some admirable scenes in Ben Jonson’s Volpone, shewing the
humours of a legacy-hunter, and the different ways of fobbing him
off with excuses and assurances of not being forgotten. Yet it is
hardly right after all, to encourage this kind of pitiful, barefaced
intercourse, without meaning to pay for it; as the coquette has no
right to jilt the lovers she has trifled with. Flattery and submission
are marketable commodities like any other, have their price, and
ought scarcely to be obtained under false pretences. If we see
through and despise the wretched creature that attempts to impose
on our credulity, we can at any time dispense with his services; if
we are soothed by this mockery of respect and friendship, why not
pay him like any other drudge, or as we satisfy the actor who
performs a part in a play by our particular desire? But often these
premeditated disappointments are as unjust as they are cruel, and
are marked with circumstances of indignity, in proportion to the
worth of the object. The suspecting, the taking it for granted
that your name is down in the will, is sufficient provocation to have
it struck out: the hinting at an obligation, the consciousness of it
on the part of the testator, will make him determined to avoid the
formal acknowledgment of it, at any expence. The disinheriting
of relations is mostly for venial offences, not for base actions: we
punish out of pique, to revenge some case in which we have been
disappointed of our wills, some act of disobedience to what had no
reasonable ground to go upon; and we are obstinate in adhering to
our resolution, as it was sudden and rash, and doubly bent on
asserting our authority in what we have least right to interfere in.
It is the wound inflicted upon our self-love, not the stain upon the
character of the thoughtless offender, that calls for condign punishment.
Crimes, vices may go unchecked, or unnoticed: but it is
the laughing at our weaknesses, or thwarting our humours, that is
never to be forgotten. It is not the errors of others, but our own
miscalculations, on which we wreak our lasting vengeance. It is
ourselves that we cannot forgive. In the will of Nicholas Gimcrack,
the virtuoso recorded in the Tatler, we learn, among other items,
that his eldest son is cut off with a single cockle-shell for his undutiful
behaviour in laughing at his little sister whom his father kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>preserved in spirits of wine. Another of his relations has a collection
of grasshoppers bequeathed him, as in the testator’s opinion an
adequate reward and acknowledgment due to his merit. The whole
will of the said Nicholas Gimcrack, Esq. is a curious document and
exact picture of the mind of the worthy virtuoso defunct, where his
various follies, littlenesses, and quaint humours are set forth, as orderly
and distinct as his butterflies’ wings and cockle-shells and skeletons
of fleas in glass-cases.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a> We often successfully try in this way to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the finishing stroke to our pictures, hang up our weaknesses in perpetuity,
and embalm our mistakes in the memories of others.</p>

<p class='c013'>I shall not speak here of unwarrantable commands imposed upon
survivors, by which they were to carry into effect the sullen and
revengeful purposes of unprincipled men, after they had breathed their
last; but we meet with continual examples of the desire to keep up
the farce (if not the tragedy) of life, after we, the performers in it,
have quitted the stage, and to have our parts rehearsed by proxy.
We thus make a caprice immortal, a peculiarity proverbial. Hence
we see the number of legacies and fortunes left, on condition that the
legatee shall take the name and style of the testator, by which device
we provide for the continuance of the sounds that formed our names,
and endow them with an estate, that they may be repeated with proper
respect. In the Memoirs of an Heiress, all the difficulties of the plot
turn on the necessity imposed by a clause in her uncle’s will that her
future husband should take the family-name of Beverley. Poor
Cecilia! What delicate perplexities she was thrown into by this
improvident provision; and with what minute, endless, intricate distresses
has the fair authoress been enabled to harrow up the reader on
this account! There was a Sir Thomas Dyot in the reign of Charles
II. who left the whole range of property which forms Dyot-street, in
St. Giles’s, and the neighbourhood, on the sole and express condition
that it should be appropriated entirely to that sort of buildings, and to
the reception of that sort of population, which still keeps undisputed,
undivided possession of it. The name was changed the other day to
George-street as a more genteel appellation, which, I should think, is
an indirect forfeiture of the estate. This Sir Thomas Dyot I should
be disposed to put upon the list of old English worthies—as humane,
liberal, and no flincher from what he took in his head. He was no
common-place man in his line. He was the best commentator on
that old-fashioned text—‘The foxes have holes, and the birds of the
air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.’—We
find some that are curious in the mode in which they shall be
buried, and others in the place. Lord Camelford had his remains
buried under an ash-tree that grew on one of the mountains in Switzerland;
and Sir Francis Bourgeois had a little mausoleum built for him
in the College at Dulwich, where he once spent a pleasant, jovial day
with the master and wardens<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a>. It is, no doubt, proper to attend,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>except for strong reasons to the contrary, to these sort of requests;
for by breaking faith with the dead, we loosen the confidence of the
living. Besides, there is a stronger argument; we sympathise with
the dead as well as with the living, and are bound to them by the
most sacred of all ties, our own involuntary fellow-feeling with
others!</p>

<p class='c013'>Thieves, as a last donation, leave advice to their friends, physicians
a nostrum, authors a manuscript work, rakes a confession of their
faith in the virtue of the sex—all, the last dwellings of their egotism
and impertinence. One might suppose that if any thing could, the
approach and contemplation of death might bring men to a sense of
reason and self-knowledge. On the contrary, it seems only to deprive
them of the little wit they had, and to make them even more the
sport of their wilfulness and short-sightedness. Some men think
that because they are going to be hanged, they are fully authorised to
declare a future state of rewards and punishments. All either indulge
their caprices or cling to their prejudices. They make a desperate
attempt to escape from reflection by taking hold of any whim or fancy
that crosses their minds, or by throwing themselves implicitly on old
habits and attachments.</p>

<p class='c013'>An old man is twice a child: the dying man becomes the property

merged in old saws and prescriptive usages. The property we have
derived from our kindred reverts tacitly to them: and not to let
it take its course, is a sort of violence done to nature as well
as custom. The idea of property, of something in common, does
not mix cordially with friendship, but is inseparable from near
relationship. We owe a return in kind, where we feel no obligation
for a favour; and consign our possessions to our next of kin
as mechanically as we lean our heads on the pillow, and go out of
the world in the same state of stupid amazement that we came into

  <h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XIII<br /> <span class='small'>ON CERTAIN INCONSISTENCIES IN SIR JOSHUA REYNOLD’S DISCOURSES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The two chief points which Sir Joshua aims at in his Discourses are to
shew that excellence in the Fine Arts is the result of pains and study,
rather than of genius, and that all beauty, grace, and grandeur are to
be found, not in actual nature, but in an idea existing in the mind.
On both these points he appears to have fallen into considerable
inconsistencies, or very great latitude of expression, so as to make it
difficult to know what conclusion to draw from his various reasonings.
I shall attempt little more in this Essay than to bring together several
passages, that from their contradictory import seem to imply some
radical defect in Sir Joshua’s theory, and a doubt as to the possibility
of placing an implicit reliance on his authority.</p>

<p class='c013'>To begin with the first of these subjects, the question of original
genius. In the Second Discourse, On the Method of Study, Sir
Joshua observes towards the end,</p>

<p class='c013'>‘There is one precept, however, in which I shall only be opposed
by the vain, the ignorant, and the idle. I am not afraid that I shall
repeat it too often. <em>You must have no dependence on your own genius.</em>
If you have great talents, industry will improve them: if you have
but moderate abilities, industry will supply their deficiency. Nothing
is denied to well-directed labour; nothing is to be obtained without
it. Not to enter into metaphysical discussions on the nature or
essence of genius, I will venture to assert, that assiduity unabated by
difficulty, and a disposition eagerly directed to the object of its
pursuit, will produce effects similar to those which some call the
result of <em>natural powers</em>.’—Vol. I. p. 44.</p>

<p class='c013'>The only tendency of the maxim here laid down seems to be to
lure those students on with the hopes of excellence who have no
chance of succeeding, and to deter those who have, from relying on
the only prop and source of real excellence—the strong bent and
impulse of their natural powers. Industry alone can only produce
mediocrity; but mediocrity in art is not worth the trouble of industry.
Genius, great natural powers will give industry and ardour in the
pursuit of their proper object, but not if you divert them from that
object into the trammels of common-place mechanical labour. By
this method you neutralise all distinction of character—make a
pedant of the blockhead, and a drudge of the man of genius. What,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>for instance, would have been the effect of persuading Hogarth or
Rembrandt to place no dependence on their own genius, and to apply
themselves to the general study of the different branches of the art
and of every sort of excellence, with a confidence of success proportioned
to their misguided efforts, but to destroy both those great
artists? ‘You take my house when you do take the prop that doth
sustain my house!’ You undermine the superstructure of art when
you strike at its main pillar and support, confidence and faith in
nature. We might as well advise a person who had discovered a
silver or lead mine on his estate to close it up, or the common farmer
to plough up every acre he rents in the hope of discovering hidden
treasure, as advise the man of original genius to neglect his particular
vein for the study of rules and the imitation of others, or try to
persuade the man of no strong natural powers that he can supply their
deficiency by laborious application.—Sir Joshua soon after, in the
Third Discourse, alluding to the terms, <em>inspiration</em>, <em>genius</em>, <em>gusto</em>,
applied by critics and orators to painting, proceeds,</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Such is the warmth with which both the Ancients and Moderns
speak of this divine principle of the art; but, as I have formerly
observed, enthusiastick admiration seldom promotes knowledge.
Though a student by such praise may have his attention roused
and a desire excited of running in this great career; yet it is possible
that what has been said to excite, may only serve to deter him. He
examines his own mind, and perceives there nothing of that divine
inspiration, with which, he is told, so many others have been
favoured. He never travelled to heaven to gather new ideas; and
he finds himself possessed of no other qualifications than what mere
common observation and a plain understanding can confer. Thus
he becomes gloomy amidst the splendour of figurative declamation,
and thinks it hopeless to pursue an object which he supposes out of
the reach of human industry.’—Vol. I. p. 56.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet presently after he adds,</p>

<p class='c013'>‘It is not easy to define in what this great style consists; nor to
describe by words the proper means of acquiring it, <em>if the mind of the
student should be at all capable of such an acquisition</em>. Could we teach
taste or genius by rules, they would be no longer taste and genius.’—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</span></i>
p. 57.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here then Sir Joshua admits that it is a question whether the
student is likely <em>to be at all capable of such an acquisition</em> as the higher
excellences of art, though he had said in the passage just quoted
above, that it is within the reach of constant assiduity, and of a disposition
eagerly directed to the object of its pursuit, to effect all that
is usually considered as the result of natural powers. Is the theory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>which our author means to inculcate a mere delusion, a mere arbitrary
assumption? At one moment, Sir Joshua attributes the hopelessness
of the student to attain perfection to the discouraging influence of
certain figurative and overstrained expressions, and in the next doubts
his capacity for such an acquisition under any circumstances. Would
he have him hope against hope, then? If he ‘examines his own
mind and finds nothing there of that divine inspiration, with which
he is told so many others have been favoured,’ but which he has
never felt himself; if ‘he finds himself possessed of no other qualifications’
for the highest efforts of genius and imagination ‘than
what mere common observation and a plain understanding can confer,’
he may as well desist at once from ‘ascending the brightest heaven
of invention:’—if the very idea of the divinity of art deters instead of
animating him, if the enthusiasm with which others speak of it damps
the flame in his own breast, he had better not enter into a competition
where he wants the first principle of success, the daring to aspire and
the hope to excel. He may be assured he is not the man. Sir
Joshua himself was not struck at first by the sight of the masterpieces
of the great style of art, and he seems unconsciously to have adopted
this theory to shew that he might still have succeeded in it but for
want of due application. His hypothesis goes to this—to make the
common run of his readers fancy they can do all that can be done by
genius, and to make the man of genius believe he can only do what
is to be done by mechanical rules and systematic industry. This is
not a very feasible scheme; nor is Sir Joshua sufficiently clear and
explicit in his reasoning in support of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>In speaking of Carlo Maratti, he confesses the inefficiency of this
doctrine in a very remarkable manner:—</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Carlo Maratti succeeded better than those I have first named,
and I think owes his superiority to the extension of his views:
besides his master Andrea Sacchi, he imitated Raffaelle, Guido, and
the Caraccis. It is true, there is nothing very captivating in Carlo
Maratti; but this proceeded from a want which cannot be completely
supplied; that is, want of strength of parts. <em>In this certainly men
are not equal</em>; and a man can bring home wares only in proportion to
the capital with which he goes to market. Carlo, by diligence, made
the most of what he had: but there was undoubtedly a heaviness about
him, which extended itself uniformly to his invention, expression,
his drawing, colouring, and the general effect of his pictures. The
truth is, he never equalled any of his patterns in any one thing, and
he added little of his own.’—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</span></i> p. 172.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here then Reynolds, we see, fairly gives up the argument.
Carlo, after all, was a heavy hand; nor could all his diligence and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>his making the most of what he had, make up for the want of
‘natural powers.’ Sir Joshua’s good sense pointed out to him the
truth in the individual instance, though he might be led astray by a
vague general theory. Such however is the effect of a false
principle that there is an evident bias in the artist’s mind to make
genius lean upon others for support, instead of trusting to itself, and
developing its own incommunicable resources. So in treating in the
Twelfth Discourse of the way in which great artists are formed,
Sir Joshua reverts very nearly to his first position.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘The daily food and nourishment of the mind of an Artist is found
in the great works of his predecessors. There is no other way for
him to become great himself. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Serpens, nisi serpentem comederit,
non fit draco.</span></i> Raffaelle, as appears from what has been said, had
carefully studied the works of Masaccio, and indeed there was no
other, if we except Michael Angelo (whom he likewise imitated)<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
so worthy of his attention: and though his manner was dry and
hard, his compositions formal, and not enough diversified, according
to the custom of Painters in that early period, yet his works possess
that grandeur and simplicity which accompany, and even sometimes
proceed from, regularity and hardness of manner. We must consider
the barbarous state of the arts before his time, when skill in
drawing was so little understood, that the best of the painters could
not even foreshorten the foot, but every figure appeared to stand upon
his toes; and what served for drapery had, from the hardness and
smallness of the folds, too much the appearance of cords clinging
round the body. He first introduced large drapery, flowing in an
easy and natural manner: indeed he appears to be the first who discovered
the path that leads to every excellence to which the art
afterwards arrived, and may therefore be justly considered as one of
the Great Fathers of Modern Art.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Though I have been led on to a longer digression respecting this
great painter than I intended, yet I cannot avoid mentioning another
excellence which he possessed in a very eminent degree; he was as
much distinguished among his contemporaries for his diligence and
industry, <em>as he was for the natural faculties of his mind</em>. We are told
that his whole attention was absorbed in the pursuit of his art, and
that he acquired the name of Masaccio from his total disregard to his
dress, his person, and all the common concerns of life. He is indeed
<em>a signal instance of what well-directed diligence</em> will do in a short time:
he lived but twenty-seven years; yet in that short space carried
the art so far beyond what it had before reached, that he appears to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>stand alone as a model for his successors. Vasari gives a long
catalogue of painters and sculptors who formed their taste and learned
their art, by studying his works; among those, he names Michael
Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Pietro Perugino, Raffaelle, Bartolomeo,
Andrea del Sarto, Il Rosso, and Pierino del Vaga.’—Vol. II. p. 95.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Joshua here again halts between two opinions. He tells us the
names of the painters who formed themselves upon Masaccio’s style:
he does not tell us on whom he formed himself. At one time the
natural faculties of his mind were as remarkable as his industry; at
another he was only a signal instance of what well-directed diligence
will do in a short time. Then again ‘he appears to have been the
first who discovered the path that leads to every excellence to which
the Art afterwards arrived,’ though he is introduced in an argument
to shew that ‘the daily food and nourishment of the mind of the
Artist must be found in the works of his predecessors.’ There is
something surely very wavering and unsatisfactory in all this.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Joshua, in another part of his work, endeavours to reconcile
and prop up these contradictions by a paradoxical sophism which I
think turns upon himself. He says, ‘I am on the contrary persuaded,
that by imitation only’ (by which he has just explained himself to
mean the study of other masters) ‘variety and even originality of
invention is produced. I will go further; even genius, at least, what
is so called, is the child of imitation. But as this appears to be contrary
to the general opinion, I must explain my position before I
enforce it.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Genius is supposed to be a power of producing excellencies,
which are out of the reach of the rules of art; a power which no precepts
can teach, and which no industry can acquire.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘This opinion of the impossibility of acquiring those beauties,
which stamp the work with the character of genius, supposes that it
is something more fixed than in reality it is; and that we always do
and ever did agree in opinion, with respect to what should be considered
as the characteristick of genius. But the truth is, that the
<em>degree</em> of excellence which proclaims <em>Genius</em> is different in different
times and different places; and what shows it to be so is, that mankind
have often changed their opinion upon this matter.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘When the Arts were in their infancy, the power of merely
drawing the likeness of any object, was considered as one of its
greatest efforts. The common people, ignorant of the principles of
art, talk the same language even to this day. But when it was found
that every man could be taught to do this, and a great deal more,
merely by the observance of certain precepts; the name of Genius
then shifted its application, and was given only to him who added the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>peculiar character of the object he represented; to him who had
invention, expression, grace, or dignity, in short, those qualities or
excellencies, the power of producing which could not <em>then</em> be taught
by any known and promulgated rules.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘We are very sure that the beauty of form, the expression of the
passions, the art of composition, even the power of giving a general
air of grandeur to a work, is at present very much under the
dominion of rules. These excellencies were heretofore considered
merely as the effects of genius; and justly, if genius is not taken for
inspiration, but as the effect of close observation and experience.’—<span class='sc'>The
Sixth Discourse</span>, Vol. I. p. 153.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Joshua began with undertaking to shew that ‘genius was the
child of the imitation of others; and now it turns out not to be
inspiration indeed, but the effect of close observation and experience.’
The whole drift of this argument appears to be contrary to what the
writer intended; for the obvious inference is that the essence of
genius consists entirely, both in kind and degree, in the single circumstance
of originality. The very same things are or are not genius,
according as they proceed from invention or from mere imitation.
In so far as a thing is original, as it has never been done before, it
acquires and it deserves the appellation of genius: in so far as it is
not original, and is borrowed from others or taught by rule, it is not,
neither is it called, genius. This does not make much for the supposition
that genius is a traditional and second-hand quality. Because,
for example, a man without much genius can copy a picture of
Michael Angelo’s, does it follow that there was no genius in the
original design, or that the inventor and the copyist are equal? If
indeed, as Sir Joshua labours to prove, mere imitation of existing
models and attention to established rules could produce results exactly
similar to those of natural powers, if the progress of art as a learned
profession were a gradual but continual accumulation of individual
excellence, instead of being a sudden and almost miraculous start to
the highest beauty and grandeur nearly at first, and a regular declension
to mediocrity ever after, then indeed the distinction between
genius and imitation would be little worth contending for; the causes
might be different, the effects would be the same, or rather skill to
avail ourselves of external advantages would be of more importance
and efficacy than the most powerful internal resources. But as the
case stands, all the great works of art have been the offspring of
individual genius, either projecting itself before the general advances
of society or striking out a separate path for itself; all the rest is but
labour in vain. For every purpose of emulation or instruction, we go
back to the original inventors, not to those who imitated, and as it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>falsely pretended, improved upon their models: or if those who
followed have at any time attained as high a rank or surpassed their
predecessors, it was not from borrowing their excellences, but by
unfolding new and exquisite powers of their own, of which the
moving principle lay in the individual mind, and not in the stimulus
afforded by previous example and general knowledge. Great faults,
it is true, may be avoided, but great excellences can never be attained
in this way. If Sir Joshua’s hypothesis of progressive refinement in
art was any thing more than a verbal fallacy, why does he go back to
Michael Angelo as the God of his idolatry? Why does he find
fault with Carlo Maratti for being heavy? Or why does he declare
as explicitly as truly, that ‘the judgment, after it has been long
passive, by degrees loses its power of becoming active when exertion
is necessary?’—Once more to point out the fluctuation in Sir Joshua’s
notions on this subject of the advantages of natural genius and artificial
study, he says, when recommending the proper objects of ambition to
the young artist—</p>

<p class='c013'>‘My advice in a word is this: keep your principal attention fixed
upon the higher excellencies. If you compass them, and compass
nothing more, you are still in the first class. We may regret the
innumerable beauties which you may want; you may be very
imperfect; but still you are an imperfect artist of the highest order.’—Vol.
I. p. 116.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is in the Fifth Discourse. In the Seventh our artist seems
to waver, and fling a doubt on his former decision, whereby ‘it loses
some colour.’</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Indeed perfection in an inferior style may be reasonably preferred
to mediocrity in the highest walks of art. A landscape of Claude
Lorraine <em>may</em><a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a> be preferred to a history by Luca Giordano: but
hence appears the necessity of the connoisseur’s knowing in what
consists the excellency of each class, in order to judge how near it
approaches to perfection.’—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</span></i> p. 217.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he advances, however, he grows bolder, and altogether discards
his theory of judging of the artist by the class to which he belongs—‘But
we have the sanction of all mankind,’ he says, ‘in preferring
genius in a lower rank of art, to feebleness and insipidity in the
highest.’ This is in speaking of Gainsborough. The whole passage
is excellent, and, I should think, conclusive against the general and
factitious style of art on which he insists so much at other times.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘On this ground, however unsafe, I will venture to prophesy, that
two of the last distinguished Painters of that country, I mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Pompeio Battoni, and Raffaelle Mengs, however great their names
may at present sound in our ears,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a> will very soon fall into the rank of
Imperiale, Sebastian Concha, Placido Constanza, Massuccio, and the
rest of their immediate predecessors; whose names, though equally
renowned in their life-time, are now fallen into what is little short of
total oblivion. I do not say that those painters were not superior to
the artist I allude to,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> and whose loss we lament, in a certain routine
of practice, which, to the eyes of common observers, has the air of a
learned composition, and bears a sort of superficial resemblance to the
manner of the great men who went before them. I know this
perfectly well; but I know likewise, that a man looking for real and
lasting reputation must unlearn much of the common-place method so
observable in the works of the artists whom I have named. For my
own part, I confess, I take more interest in and am more captivated
with the powerful impression of nature, which Gainsborough exhibited
in his portraits and in his landscapes, and the interesting simplicity
and elegance of his little ordinary beggar-children, than with any of
the works of that School, since the time of Andrea Sacchi, or
perhaps we may say, Carlo Maratti; two painters who may truly be
said to be <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ultimi Romanorum</span></span>.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I am well aware how much I lay myself open to the censure and
ridicule of the Academical professors of other nations, in preferring
the humble attempts of Gainsborough to the works of those regular
graduates in the great historical style. <em>But we have the sanction of all
mankind in preferring genius in a lower rank of art to feebleness and
insipidity in the highest.</em>’—Vol. II. p. 152.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet this excellent artist and critic had said but a few pages before,
when working upon his theory—‘For this reason I shall beg leave
to lay before you a few thoughts on the subject; to throw out some
hints that may lead your minds to an opinion (which I take to be the
true one) that Painting is not only not to be considered as an imitation
operating by deception, but that it is, and ought to be, in many points
of view and strictly speaking, no imitation at all of external nature.
Perhaps it ought to be as far removed from the vulgar idea of
imitation as the refined civilised state in which we live is removed
from a gross state of nature; and those who have not cultivated their
imaginations, which the majority of mankind certainly have not, may
be said, in regard to arts, to continue in this state of nature. Such
men will always prefer imitation’ (the imitation of nature) ‘to that
excellence which is addressed to another faculty that they do not
possess; but these are not the persons to whom a painter is to look,
any more than a judge of morals and manners ought to refer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>controverted points upon those subjects to the opinions of people
taken from the banks of the Ohio, or from New Holland.’—Vol. II.
p. 119.</p>

<p class='c013'>In opposition to the sentiment here expressed, that ‘Painting is and
ought to be, in many points of view and strictly speaking, no imitation
at all of external nature,’ it is emphatically said in another
place—‘Nature is and must be the fountain which alone is inexhaustible;
and from which all excellencies must originally flow.’—Discourse
VI. Vol. I. p. 162.</p>

<p class='c013'>I cannot undertake to reconcile so many contradictions, nor do
I think it an easy task for the student to derive any simple or intelligible
clue from these conflicting authorities and broken hints in
the prosecution of his art. Sir Joshua appears to have imbibed from
others (Burke or Johnson) a spurious metaphysical notion that art
was to be preferred to nature, and learning to genius, with which his
own good sense and practical observation were continually at war,
but from which he only emancipates himself for a moment to relapse
into the same error again shortly after.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a> The conclusion of the
Twelfth Discourse is, I think, however, a triumphant and unanswerable
denunciation of his own favourite paradox on the objects and
study of art.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Those artists,’ (he says with a strain of eloquent truth,) ‘who
have quitted the service of nature, (whose service, when well understood,
is <em>perfect freedom</em>,) and have put themselves under the direction
of I know not what capricious fantastical mistress, who fascinates and
overpowers their whole mind, and from whose dominion there are no
hopes of their being ever reclaimed (since they appear perfectly
satisfied, and not at all conscious of their forlorn situation) like the
transformed followers of Comus.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Methinks, such men, who have found out so short a path, have

<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>On the contrary, he who recurs to nature, at every recurrence renews
his strength. The rules of art he is never likely to forget: they
are few and simple: but Nature is refined, subtle, and infinitely
various, beyond the power and retention of memory; it is necessary
therefore to have continual recourse to her. In this intercourse, there
is no end of his improvement: the longer he lives, the nearer he
approaches to the true and perfect idea of Art.’—Vol. II. p. 108.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XIV<br /> <span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>The first inquiry which runs through Sir Joshua Reynolds’s
Discourses is, whether the student ought to look at nature with his
own eyes or with the eyes of others, and on the whole, he apparently
inclines to the latter. The second question is, what is to be understood
by nature; whether it is a general and abstract idea, or an
aggregate of particulars; and he strenuously maintains the former of
these positions. Yet it is not easy always to determine how far or
with what precise limitations he does so.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first germ of his speculations on this subject is to be found in
two papers in the Idler. In the last paragraph of the second of these,
he says,</p>

<p class='c013'>‘If it has been proved that the Painter, by attending to the
invariable and general ideas of nature, produces beauty, he must, by
regarding minute particularities and accidental discriminations, deviate
from the universal rule, and pollute his canvas with deformity.’—See
Works, Vol. II. p. 242.</p>

<p class='c013'>In answer to this, I would say that deformity is not the being
varied in the particulars, in which all things differ (for on this
principle all nature, which is made up of individuals, would be a heap
of deformity) but in violating general rules, in which they all or
almost all agree. Thus there are no two noses in the world exactly
alike, or without a great variety of subordinate parts, which may still
be handsome, but a face without any nose at all, or a nose (like that
of a mask) without any particularity in the details, would be a great
deformity in art or nature. Sir Joshua seems to have been led into
his notions on this subject either by an ambiguity of terms, or by
taking only one view of nature. He supposes grandeur, or the
general effect of the whole, to consist in leaving out the particular
details, because these details are sometimes found without any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>grandeur of effect, and he therefore conceives the two things to be
irreconcileable and the alternatives of each other. This is very
imperfect reasoning. If the mere leaving out the details constituted
grandeur, any one could do this: the greatest dauber would at that
rate be the greatest artist. A house or sign-painter might instantly
enter the lists with Michael Angelo, and might look down on the
little, dry, hard manner of Raphael. But grandeur depends on a
distinct principle of its own, not on a negation of the parts; and as
it does not arise from their omission, so neither is it incompatible
with their insertion or the highest finishing. In fact, an artist may
give the minute particulars of any object one by one, and with the
utmost care, and totally neglect the proportions, arrangement and
general masses, on which the effect of the whole more immediately
depends; or he may give the latter, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> the proportions and
arrangement of the larger parts and the general masses of light and
shade, and leave all the minuter parts of which those parts are composed
a mere blotch, one general smear, like the first crude and hasty
getting in of the ground-work of a picture: he may do either of these,
or he may combine both, that is, finish the parts, but put them in their
right places, and keep them in due subordination to the general effect
and massing of the whole. If the exclusion of the parts were necessary
to the grandeur of the whole composition, if the more entire this
exclusion, if the more like a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula rasa</span></i>, a vague, undefined, shadowy
and abstracted representation the picture was, the greater the grandeur,
there could be no danger of pushing this principle too far, and going the
full length of Sir Joshua’s theory without any restrictions or mental
reservations. But neither of these suppositions is true. The greatest
grandeur may co-exist with the most perfect, nay with a microscopic
accuracy of detail, as we see it does often in nature: the greatest
looseness and slovenliness of execution may be displayed without any
grandeur at all either in the outline or distribution of the masses of
colour. To explain more particularly what I mean. I have seen
and copied portraits by Titian, in which the eyebrows were marked
with a number of small strokes, like hair-lines (indeed, the hairs of
which they were composed were in a great measure given)—but did
this destroy the grandeur of expression, the truth of outline, arising
from the arrangement of these hair-lines in a given form? The
grandeur, the character, the expression remained, for the general form
or arched and expanded outline remained, just as much as if it had
been daubed in with a blacking-brush: the introduction of the
internal parts and texture only added delicacy and truth to the
general and striking effect of the whole. Surely a number of small
dots or lines may be arranged into the form of a square or a circle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>indiscriminately; the square or circle, that is, the larger figure,
remains the same, whether the line of which it consists is broken or
continuous; as we may see in prints where the outlines, features, and
masses remain the same in all the varieties of mezzotinto, dotted and
line engraving. If Titian in marking the appearance of the hairs had
deranged the general shape and contour of the eyebrows, he would
have destroyed the look of nature; but as he did not, but kept both
in view, he proportionately improved his copy of it. So in what
regards the masses of light and shade, the variety, the delicate transparency
and broken transitions of the tints is not inconsistent with the
greatest breadth or boldest contrasts. If the light, for instance, is
thrown strongly on one side of a face, and the other is cast into deep
shade, let the individual and various parts of the surface be finished
with the most scrupulous exactness both in the drawing and in the
colours: provided nature is not exceeded, this will not nor cannot
destroy the force and harmony of the composition. One side of the
face will still have that great and leading distinction of being seen in
shadow, and the other of being seen in the light, let the subordinate
differences be as many and as precise as they will. Suppose a
panther is painted in the sun: will it be necessary to leave out the
spots to produce breadth and the great style, or will not this be done
more effectually by painting the spots of one side of his shaggy coat
as they are seen in the light, and those of the other as they really
appear in natural shadow? the two masses are thus preserved completely,
and no offence is done to truth and nature. Otherwise we
resolve the distribution of light and shade into <em>local colouring</em>. The
masses, the grandeur exist equally in external nature with the local
differences of different colours. Yet Sir Joshua seems to argue that
the grandeur, the effect of the whole object, is confined to the general
idea in the mind, and that all the littleness and individuality is in
nature. This is an essentially false view of the subject. This
grandeur, this general effect, is indeed always combined with the
details, or what our theoretical reasoner would designate as <em>littleness</em>
in nature: and so it ought to be in art, as far as art can follow nature
with prudence and profit. What is the fault of Denner’s style? It
is, that he does <em>not</em> give this combination of properties: that he gives
only one view of nature, that he abstracts the details, the finishing,
the curiosities of natural appearances from the general result, truth and
character of the whole, and in finishing every part with elaborate
care, totally loses sight of the more important and striking appearance
of the object as it presents itself to us in nature. He gives every part
of a face; but the shape, the expression, the light and shade of the
whole is wrong, and as far as can be from what is natural. He gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>an infinite variety of tints, but they are not the tints of the human
face, nor are they subjected to any principle of light and shade. He
is different from Rembrandt or Titian. The English school, formed
on Sir Joshua’s theory, give neither the finishing of the parts nor the
effect of the whole, but an inexplicable dumb mass without distinction
or meaning. They do not do as Denner did, and think that not to
do as he did is to do as Titian and Rembrandt did; I do not know
whether they would take it as a compliment to be supposed to
imitate nature. Some few artists, it must be said, have ‘of late
reformed this indifferently among us! Oh! let them reform it
altogether!’ I have no doubt they would if they could; but I have
some doubts whether they can or not.—Before I proceed to consider
the question of beauty and grandeur as it relates to the selection of
form, I will quote a few passages from Sir Joshua with reference to
what has been said on the imitation of particular objects. In the
Third Discourse he observes, ‘I will now add that nature herself is
not to be too closely copied.... A mere copier of nature <em>can never
produce any thing great; can never raise and enlarge the conceptions, or
warm the heart of the spectator</em>. The wish of the genuine painter
must be more extensive: instead of endeavouring to amuse mankind
with the minute neatness of his imitations, he must endeavour to
improve them by the grandeur of his ideas; instead of seeking praise
by deceiving the superficial sense of the spectator, he must strive for
fame by captivating the imagination.’—Vol. I. p. 53.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this passage it would surely seem that there was nothing in
nature but minute neatness and superficial effect: nothing great in <em>her</em>
style, for an imitator of it can produce nothing great; nothing ‘to
enlarge the conceptions or warm the heart of the spectator.’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What word hath passed thy lips, Adam severe?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>All that is truly grand or excellent is a figment of the imagination, a
vapid creation out of nothing, a pure effect of overlooking and
scorning the minute neatness of natural objects. This will not do.
Again, Sir Joshua lays it down without any qualification that</p>

<p class='c013'>‘The whole beauty and grandeur of the art consists in being able
to get above all singular forms, local customs, peculiarities, and <em>details</em>
of every kind.’—Page 58.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet at p. 82 we find him acknowledging a different opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I am very ready to allow’ (he says, in speaking of history-painting)
‘that <em>some</em> circumstances of minuteness and particularity
<em>frequently</em> tend to give an air of truth to a piece, and <em>to interest the
spectator in an extraordinary manner</em>. Such circumstances therefore
cannot wholly be rejected: but if there be any thing in the Art
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>which requires peculiar nicety of discernment, it is the disposition of
these minute circumstantial parts; which, according to the judgment
employed in the choice, become so useful to truth or so injurious to
grandeur.’—Page 82.</p>

<p class='c013'>That’s true; but the sweeping clause against ‘all particularities
and details of every kind’ is clearly got rid of. The undecided state
of Sir Joshua’s feelings on this subject of the incompatibility between
the whole and the details is strikingly manifested in two short passages
which follow each other in the space of two pages. Speaking of
some pictures of Paul Veronese and Rubens as distinguished by the
dexterity and the unity of style displayed in them, he adds—</p>

<p class='c013'>‘It is by this and this alone, that the mechanical power is ennobled,
and raised much above its natural rank. And it appears to me, that
with propriety it acquires this character, as an instance of that
superiority with which mind predominates over matter, by contracting
into one whole what nature has made multifarious.’—Vol. II.
p. 63.</p>

<p class='c013'>This would imply that the principle of unity and integrity is only
in the mind, and that nature is a heap of disjointed, disconnected
particulars, a chaos of points and atoms. In the very next page, the
following sentence occurs—</p>

<p class='c013'>‘As painting is an art, they’ (the ignorant) ‘think they ought to
be pleased in proportion as they see that art ostentatiously displayed;
they will from this supposition prefer neatness, high finishing, and
gaudy colouring, to the truth, simplicity and <em>unity</em> of nature.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Before, neatness and high finishing were supposed to belong exclusively
to the littleness of nature, but here truth, simplicity and
unity are her characteristics. Soon after, Sir Joshua says, ‘I should
be sorry if what has been said should be understood to have any
tendency to encourage that carelessness which leaves work in an unfinished
state. I commend nothing for the want of exactness; I
mean to point out that kind of exactness which is the best, and
which is alone truly to be so esteemed.’—Vol. II. p. 65. This Sir
Joshua has already told us consists in getting above ‘all particularities
and details of every kind.’ Once more we find it is stated that</p>

<p class='c013'>‘It is in vain to attend to the variation of tints, if in that attention
the general hue of flesh is lost; or to finish ever so minutely the
parts, if the masses are not observed, or the whole not well put
together.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing can be truer: but why always suppose the two things at
variance with each other?</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Titian’s manner was then new to the world, but that unshaken
truth on which it is founded, has fixed it as a model to all succeeding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>painters; and those who will examine into the artifice, will find it to
consist in the power of generalising, and in the shortness and simplicity
of the means employed.’—Page 51.</p>

<p class='c013'>Titian’s real excellence consisted in the power of generalising and
of <em>individualising</em> at the same time: if it were merely the former, it
would be difficult to account for the error immediately after pointed
out by Sir Joshua. He says in the very next paragraph:</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Many artists, as Vasari likewise observes, have ignorantly imagined
they are imitating the manner of Titian, when they leave their colours
rough, and neglect the detail: but not possessing the principles on
which he wrought, they have produced what he calls <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">goffe pitture</span></i>,
absurd, foolish pictures.’—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</span></i> p. 54.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many artists have also imagined they were following the directions
of Sir Joshua when they did the same thing, that is, neglected the
detail, and produced the same results, vapid generalities, absurd,
foolish pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>I will only give two short passages more, and have done with this
part of the subject. I am anxious to confront Sir Joshua with his
own authority.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘The advantage of this method of considering objects (<em>as a whole</em>)
is what I wish now more particularly to enforce. At the same time
I do not forget, that a painter must have the power of contracting as
well as dilating his sight; because he that does not at all express
particulars, expresses nothing; yet it is certain that a nice discrimination
of minute circumstances, and a punctilious delineation of them,
whatever excellence it may have (and I do not mean to detract from
it), never did confer on the artist the character of Genius.’—Vol. II.
p. 44.</p>

<p class='c013'>At page 53, we find the following words:</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Whether it is the human figure, and animal, or even inanimate
objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may
be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the
hands of a Painter of genius. What was said of Virgil, that he
threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may
be applied to Titian; whatever he touched, however naturally mean,
and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur
and importance.’—No, not by magic, but by seeking and finding in
individual nature, and combined with details of every kind, that grace
and grandeur and unity of effect which Sir Joshua supposes to be a
mere creation of the artist’s brain! Titian’s practice was, I conceive,
to give general appearances with individual forms and circumstances:
Sir Joshua’s theory goes too often, and, in its prevailing bias, to
separate the two things as inconsistent with each other, and thereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>to destroy or bring into question that union of striking effect with
accuracy of resemblance in which the essence of sound art (as far as
relates to imitation) consists.</p>

<p class='c013'>Farther, as Sir Joshua is inclined to merge the details of individual
objects in general effect, so he is resolved to reduce all beauty or
grandeur in natural objects to a central form or abstract idea of a
certain class, so as to exclude all peculiarities or deviations from this
ideal standard as unfit subjects for the artist’s pencil, and as polluting
his canvas with deformity. As the former principle went to destroy
all exactness and solidity in particular things, this goes to confound
all variety, distinctness, and characteristic force in the broader scale
of nature. There is a principle of conformity in nature or of something
in common between a number of individuals of the same class,
but there is also a principle of contrast, of discrimination and identity,
which is equally essential in the system of the universe and in the
structure of our ideas both of art and nature. Sir Joshua would
hardly neutralise the tints of the rainbow to produce a dingy grey,
as a medium or central colour: why then should he neutralise all
features, forms, &amp;c. to produce an insipid monotony? He does not
indeed consider his theory of beauty as applicable to colour, which he
well understood, but insists upon, and literally enforces it as to form
and ideal conceptions, of which he knew comparatively little, and
where his authority is more questionable. I will not in this place
undertake to shew that his theory of a middle form (as the standard
of taste and beauty) is not true of the outline of the human face and
figure or other organic bodies, though I think that even there it is
only one principle or condition of beauty; but I do say that it has
little or nothing to do with those other capital parts of painting,
colour, character, expression, and grandeur of conception. Sir
Joshua himself contends that ‘beauty in creatures of the same species
is the medium or centre of all its various forms;’ and he maintains
that grandeur is the same abstraction of the species in the individual.
Therefore beauty and grandeur must be the same thing, which they
are not; so that this definition must be faulty. Grandeur I should
suppose to imply something that elevates and expands the mind,
which is chiefly power or magnitude. Beauty is that which soothes
and melts it, and its source I apprehend is a certain harmony,
softness, and gradation of form, within the limits of our customary
associations, no doubt, or of what we expect of certain species, but
not independent of every other consideration. Our critic himself
confesses of Michael Angelo, whom he regards as the pattern of the
great and sublime style, that ‘his people are a superior order of
beings; there is nothing about them, nothing in the air of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>actions or their attitudes, or the style or cast of their limbs or
features, that reminds us of their belonging to our own species.
Rafaelle’s imagination is not so elevated: his figures are not so much
disjoined from our own diminutive race of beings, though his ideas
are chaste, noble, and of great conformity to their subjects. Michael
Angelo’s works have a strong, peculiar, and marked character: they
seem to proceed from his own mind entirely, and that mind so rich
and abundant, that he never needed or seemed to disdain to look
abroad for foreign help. Rafaelle’s materials are generally borrowed,
though the noble structure is his own.’ <span class='sc'>Fifth Discourse.</span> How
does all this accord with the same writer’s favourite theory that all
beauty, all grandeur, and all excellence, consist in an approximation
to that central form or habitual idea of mediocrity, from which
every deviation is so much deformity and littleness? Michael
Angelo’s figures are raised above our diminutive race of beings,
yet they are confessedly the standard of sublimity in what regards
the human form. Grandeur then admits of an exaggeration of
our habitual impressions; and ‘the strong, marked, and peculiar
character which Michael Angelo has at the same time given to his
works,’ does not take away from it. This is fact against argument.
I would take Sir Joshua’s word for the goodness of a picture, and
for its distinguishing properties, sooner than I would for an abstract
metaphysical theory. Our artist also speaks continually of high and
low subjects. There can be no distinction of this kind upon his
principle, that the standard of taste is the adhering to the central form
of each species, and that every species is in itself equally beautiful.
The painter of flowers, of shells, or of any thing else, is equally
elevated with Raphael or Michael, if he adheres to the generic or
established form of what he paints: the rest, according to this definition,
is a matter of indifference. There must therefore be something
besides the central or customary form to account for the difference of
dignity, for the high and low style in nature or in art. Michael
Angelo’s figures, we are told, are more than ordinarily grand: why,
by the same rule, may not Raphael’s be more than ordinarily beautiful,
have more than ordinary softness, symmetry, and grace?—Character
and expression are still less included in the present theory. All
character is a departure from the common-place form; and Sir Joshua
makes no scruple to declare that expression destroys beauty. Thus
he says,</p>

<p class='c013'>‘If you mean to preserve the most perfect beauty <em>in its most perfect
state</em>, you cannot express the passions, all of which produce distortion
and deformity, more or less, in the most beautiful faces.’—Vol. I.
p. 118.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>He goes on—‘Guido, from want of choice in adapting his subject
to his ideas and his powers, or from attempting to preserve beauty
where it could not be preserved, has in this respect succeeded very
ill. His figures are often engaged in subjects that required great
expression: yet his Judith and Holofernes, the daughter of Herodias
with the Baptist’s head, the Andromeda, and some even of the
Mothers of the Innocents, have little more expression than his Venus
attired by the Graces.’—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</span></i></p>

<p class='c013'>What a censure is this passed upon Guido, and what a condemnation
of his own theory, which would reduce and level all that is truly
great and praiseworthy in art to this insipid, tasteless standard, by
setting aside as illegitimate all that does not come within the middle,
central form! Yet Sir Joshua judges of Hogarth as he deviates
from this standard, not as he excels in individual character, which he
says is only good or tolerable as it partakes of general nature; and he
might accuse Michael Angelo and Raphael, the one for his grandeur
of style, the other for his expression; for neither are what he sets
up as the goal of perfection.—I will just stop to remark here, that
Sir Joshua has committed himself very strangely in speaking of the
character and expression to be found in the Greek statues. He says
in one place—</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I cannot quit the Apollo, without making one observation on the
character of this figure. He is supposed to have just discharged his
arrow at the Python; and by the head retreating a little towards the
right shoulder, he appears attentive to its effect. What I would
remark, is the difference of this attention from that of the Discobolus,
who is engaged in the same purpose, watching the effect of his Discus.
The graceful, negligent, though animated air of the one, and the
vulgar eagerness of the other, furnish an instance of the judgment of
the ancient Sculptors <em>in their nice discrimination of character</em>. They
are both equally true to nature, and equally admirable.’—Vol. II.
p. 21.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a few observations on the limited means of the art of Sculpture,
and the inattention of the ancients to almost every thing but form, we
meet with the following passage:—</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Those who think Sculpture can express more than we have allowed
may ask, by what means we discover, at the first glance, the character
that is represented in a Bust, a Cameo, or Intaglio? I suspect it will
be found, on close examination, by him who is resolved not to see
more than he really does see, that the figures are distinguished by
their <em>insignia</em> more than by any variety of form or beauty. Take
from Apollo his Lyre, from Bacchus his Thyrsus and Vine-leaves,
and Meleager the Boar’s Head, and there will remain little or no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>difference in their characters. In a Juno, Minerva, or Flora, the
idea of the artist seems to have gone no further than representing
perfect beauty, and afterwards adding the proper attributes, with a
total indifference to which they gave them.’</p>

<p class='c013'>[What then becomes of that ‘nice discrimination of character’ for
which our author has just before celebrated them?]</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Thus John De Bologna, after he had finished a group of a young
man holding up a young woman in his arms, with an old man at his
feet, called his friends together, to tell him what name he should give
it, and it was agreed to call it The Rape of the Sabines; and this
is the celebrated group which now stands before the old Palace at
Florence. The figures have the same general expression which is to
be found in most of the antique Sculpture; and yet it would be no
wonder, if future critics should find out delicacy of expression which
was never intended; and go so far as to see, in the old man’s countenance,
the exact relation which he bore to the woman who appears to
be taken from him.’—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</span></i> p. 25.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it is that Sir Joshua’s theory seems to rest on an inclined plane,
and is always glad of an excuse to slide, from the severity of truth and
nature, into the milder and more equable regions of insipidity and
inanity! I am sorry to say so, but so it appears to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>I confess, it strikes me as a self-evident truth that variety or contrast
is as essential a principle in art and nature as uniformity, and
as necessary to make up the harmony of the universe and the contentment
of the mind. Who would destroy the shifting effects of
light and shade, the sharp, lively opposition of colours in the same or
in different objects, the streaks in a flower, the stains in a piece of
marble, to reduce all to the same neutral, dead colouring, the same
middle tint? Yet it is on this principle that Sir Joshua would get
rid of all variety, character, expression, and picturesque effect in
forms, or at least measure the worth or the spuriousness of all these
according to their reference to or departure from a given or average
standard. Surely, nature is more liberal, art is wider than Sir Joshua’s
theory. Allow (for the sake of argument) that all forms are in themselves
indifferent, and that beauty or the sense of pleasure in forms
can therefore only arise from customary association, or from that
middle impression to which they all tend: yet this cannot by the
same rule apply to other things. Suppose there is no capacity in
form to affect the mind except from its corresponding to previous
expectation, the same thing cannot be said of the idea of power or
grandeur. No one can say that the idea of power does not affect the
mind with the sense of awe and sublimity. That is, power and
weakness, grandeur and littleness, are not indifferent things, the perfection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>of which consists in a medium between both. Again, expression
is not a thing indifferent in itself, which derives its value or its
interest solely from its conformity to a neutral standard. Who would
neutralise the expression of pleasure and pain? Or say that the
passions of the human mind, pity, love, joy, sorrow, &amp;c. are only
interesting to the imagination and worth the attention of the artist, as
he can reduce them to an equivocal state which is neither pleasant
nor painful, neither one thing nor the other? Or who would stop
short of the utmost refinement, precision, and force in the delineation
of each? Ideal expression is not neutral expression, but extreme
expression. Again, character is a thing of peculiarity, of striking
contrast, of distinction, and not of uniformity. It is necessarily
opposed to Sir Joshua’s exclusive theory, and yet it is surely a
curious and interesting field of speculation for the human mind.
Lively, spirited discrimination of character is one source of gratification
to the lover of nature and art, which it could not be, if all truth
and excellence consisted in rejecting individual traits. Ideal character
is not common-place, but consistent character marked throughout,
which may take place in history or portrait. Historical truth in a
picture is the putting the different features of the face or muscles of
the body into consistent action. The <em>picturesque</em> altogether depends
on particular points or qualities of an object, projecting as it were
beyond the middle line of beauty, and catching the eye of the spectator.
It was less, however, my intention to hazard any speculations
of my own, than to confirm the common-sense feelings on the subject
by Sir Joshua’s own admissions in different places. In the Tenth
Discourse, speaking of some objections to the Apollo, he has these
remarkable words—</p>

<p class='c013'>‘In regard to the last objection (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> that the lower half of the
figure is longer than just proportion allows) it must be remembered,
that Apollo is here in the exertion of <em>one of his peculiar powers</em>, which
is swiftness; he has therefore that proportion which is best adapted
to that character. This is no more incorrectness, than when there
is given to an Hercules an extraordinary swelling and strength of
muscles.’—Vol. II. p. 20.</p>

<p class='c013'>Strength and activity then do not depend on the middle form;
and the middle form is to be sacrificed to the representation of these
positive qualities. Character is thus allowed not only to be an
integrant part of the antique and classical style of art, but even to
take precedence of and set aside the abstract idea of beauty. Little
more would be required to justify Hogarth in his Gothic resolution,
that if he were to make a figure of Charon, he would give him bandy
legs, because watermen are generally bandy-legged. It is very well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>to talk of the abstract idea of a man or of a God, but if you come to
any thing like an intelligible proposition, you must either individualise
and define, or destroy the very idea you contemplate. Sir Joshua
goes into this question at considerable length in the Third Discourse.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘To the principle I have laid down, that the idea of beauty in each
species of beings is an invariable one, it may be objected,’ he says,
‘that in every particular species there are various central forms,
which are separate and distinct from each other, and yet are
undeniably beautiful; that in the human figure, for instance, the
beauty of Hercules is one, of the Gladiator another, of the Apollo
another, which makes so many different ideas of beauty. It is true,
indeed, that these figures are each perfect in their kind, though of
different characters and proportions; but still none of them is the
representation of an individual, but of a class. And as there is one
general form, which, as I have said, belongs to the human kind at
large, so in each of these classes there is one common idea which is
the abstract of the various individual forms belonging to that class.
Thus, though the forms of childhood and age differ exceedingly,
there is a common form in childhood, and a common form in age,
which is the more perfect as it is remote from all peculiarities.
But I must add further, that though the most perfect forms of each
of the general divisions of the human figure are ideal, and superior to
any individual form of that class; yet the highest perfection of the
human figure is not to be found in any of them. It is not in the
Hercules, nor in the Gladiator, nor in the Apollo; but in that form
which is taken from all, and which partakes equally of the activity
of the Gladiator, of the delicacy of the Apollo, and of the muscular
strength of the Hercules. For perfect beauty in any species must
combine all the characters which are beautiful in that species. It
cannot consist in any one to the exclusion of the rest: no one,
therefore, must be predominant, that no one may be deficient.’—Vol.
II. p. 64.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Joshua here supposes the distinctions of classes and character to
be necessarily combined with the general leading idea of a middle
form. This middle form is not to confound age, sex, circumstance,
under one sweeping abstraction: but we must limit the general idea
by certain specific differences and characteristic marks, belonging to
the several subordinate divisions and ramifications of each class.
This is enough to shew that there is a principle of individuality as
well as of abstraction inseparable from works of art as well as nature.
We are to keep the human form distinct from that of other living
beings, that of men from that of women; we are to distinguish
between age and infancy, between thoughtfulness and gaiety, between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>strength and softness. Where is this to stop? But Sir Joshua turns
round upon himself in this very passage, and says, ‘No: we are to
unite the strength of the Hercules with the delicacy of the Apollo;
for perfect beauty in any species must combine all the characters
which are beautiful in that species.’ Now if these different characters
are beautiful in themselves, why not give them for their own sakes
and in their most striking appearances, instead of qualifying and
softening them down in a neutral form; which must produce a
compromise, not a union of different excellencies. If all excess of
beauty, if all character is deformity, then we must try to lose it as
fast as possible in other qualities. But if strength is an excellence,
if activity is an excellence, if delicacy is an excellence, then the
perfection, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the highest degree of each of these qualities cannot be
attained but by remaining satisfied with a less degree of the rest.
But let us hear what Sir Joshua himself advances on this subject in
another part of the Discourses.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Some excellencies bear to be united, and are improved by union:
others are of a discordant nature: and the attempt to unite them only
produces a harsh jarring of incongruent principles. The attempt to
unite contrary excellencies (of form, for instance<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a>) in a single figure,
<em>can never escape degenerating into the monstrous but by sinking into the
insipid; by taking away its marked character, and weakening its
expression</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Obvious as these remarks appear, there are many writers on our
art, who not being of the profession, and consequently not knowing
what can or cannot be done, have been very liberal of absurd praises
in their description of favourite works. They always find in them
what they are resolved to find. They praise excellencies that can
hardly exist together; and above all things are fond of describing
with great exactness the expression of a mixed passion, which more
particularly appears to me out of the reach of our art.’<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>‘Such are many disquisitions which I have read on some of the
Cartoons and other pictures of Raffaelle, where the critics have
described their own imaginations; or indeed where the excellent
master himself may have attempted this expression of passions above
the powers of the art; and has, therefore, by an indistinct and
imperfect marking, left room for every imagination with equal
probability to find a passion of his own. What has been, and what
can be done in the art, is sufficiently difficult: we need not be
mortified or discouraged at not being able to execute the conceptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of a romantic imagination. Art has its boundaries, though imagination
has none. We can easily, like the ancients, suppose a Jupiter to
be possessed of all those powers and perfections which the subordinate
Deities were endowed with separately. Yet when they employed
their art to represent him, they confined his character to majesty
alone. Pliny, therefore, though we are under great obligations to
him for the information he has given us in relation to the works of
the ancient artists, is very frequently wrong when he speaks of them,
which he does very often, in the style of many of our modern
connoisseurs. He observes that in a statue of Paris, by Euphranor,
you might discover at the same time three different characters; the
dignity of a Judge of the Goddesses, the Lover of Helen, and the
Conqueror of Achilles. A statue in which you endeavour to unite
stately dignity, youthful elegance, and stern valour, must surely
possess none of these to any eminent degree.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘From hence it appears, that there is much difficulty as well as
danger in an endeavour to concentrate in a single subject those various
powers, which, rising from various points, naturally move in different
directions.’—Vol. I. p. 120.</p>

<p class='c013'>What real clue to the art or sound principles of judging the student
can derive from these contradictory statements, or in what manner it
is possible to reconcile them one to the other, I confess I am at a
loss to discover. As it appears to me, all the varieties of nature in
the infinite number of its qualities, combinations, characters, expressions,
incidents, etc. rise from distinct points or centres and
must move in distinct directions, as the forms of different species are
to be referred to a separate standard. It is the object of art to bring
them out in all their force, clearness, and precision, and not to blend
them into a vague, vapid, nondescript <em>ideal</em> conception, which pretends
to unite, but in reality destroys. Sir Joshua’s theory limits nature
and paralyses art. According to him, the middle form or the
average of our various impressions is the source from which all beauty,
pleasure, interest, imagination springs. I contend, on the contrary,
that this very variety is good in itself, nor do I agree with him that
the whole of nature as it exists in fact is stark naught, and that there
is nothing worthy of the contemplation of a wise man but that <em>ideal
perfection</em> which never existed in the world nor even on canvas.
There is something fastidious and sickly in Sir Joshua’s system. His
code of taste consists too much of negations, and not enough of
positive, prominent qualities. It accounts for nothing but the beauty
of the common Antique, and hardly for that. The merit of
Hogarth, I grant, is different from that of the Greek statues; but
I deny that Hogarth is to be measured by this standard, or by Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Joshua’s middle forms: he has powers of instruction and amusement
that ‘rising from a different point, naturally move in a different
direction,’ and completely attain their end. It would be just as
reasonable to condemn a comedy for not having the pathos of a
tragedy or the stateliness of an epic poem. If Sir Joshua Reynolds’s
theory were true, Dr. Johnson’s Irene would be a better tragedy
than any of Shakespear’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>The reasoning of the Discourses is, I think then, deficient in the
following particulars:</p>

<p class='c013'>1. It seems to imply that general effect in a picture is produced by
leaving out the details, whereas the largest masses and the grandest
outline are consistent with the utmost delicacy of finishing in the
parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. It makes no distinction between beauty and grandeur, but refers
both to an <em>ideal</em> or middle form, as the centre of the various forms
of the species, and yet inconsistently attributes the grandeur of
Michael Angelo’s style to the superhuman appearance of his prophets
and apostles.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. It does not at any time make mention of power or magnitude
in an object as a distinct source of the sublime (though this is
acknowledged unintentionally in the case of Michael Angelo, etc.),
nor of softness or symmetry of form as a distinct source of beauty,
independently of, though still in connection with another source
arising from what we are accustomed to expect from each individual
species.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. Sir Joshua’s theory does not leave room for character, but
rejects it as an anomaly.</p>

<p class='c013'>5. It does not point out the source of expression, but considers it
as hostile to beauty; and yet, lastly, he allows that the middle form,
carried to the utmost theoretical extent, neither defined by character,
nor impregnated by passion, would produce nothing but vague,
insipid, unmeaning generality.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a word, I cannot think that the theory here laid down is clear and
satisfactory, that it is consistent with itself, that it accounts for the
various excellences of art from a few simple principles, or that the
method which Sir Joshua has pursued in treating the subject is, as he
himself expresses it, ‘<em>a plain and honest method</em>.’ It is, I fear, more
calculated to baffle and perplex the student in his progress, than to
give him clear lights as to the object he should have in view, or to
furnish him with strong motives of emulation to attain it.</p>

  <h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XV<br /> <span class='small'>ON PARADOX AND COMMON-PLACE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I have been sometimes accused of a fondness for paradoxes, but I
cannot in my own mind plead guilty to the charge. I do not indeed
swear by an opinion, because it is old: but neither do I fall in love
with every extravagance at first sight, because it is new. I conceive
that a thing may have been repeated a thousand times, without being
a bit more reasonable than it was the first time: and I also conceive
that an argument or an observation may be very just, though it may so
happen that it was never stated before. But I do not take it for
granted that every prejudice is ill-founded; nor that every paradox
is self-evident, merely because it contradicts the vulgar opinion.
Sheridan once said of some speech in his acute, sarcastic way, that
‘it contained a great deal both of what was new and what was true:
but that unfortunately what was new was not true, and what was true
was not new.’ This appears to me to express the whole sense of the
question. I do not see much use in dwelling on a common-place,
however fashionable or well-established: nor am I very ambitious of
starting the most specious novelty, unless I imagine I have reason on
my side. Originality implies independence of opinion; but differs
as widely from mere singularity as from the tritest truism. It consists
in seeing and thinking for one’s-self: whereas singularity is only the
affectation of saying something to contradict other people, without
having any real opinion of one’s own upon the matter. Mr. Burke
was an original, though an extravagant writer; Mr. Windham was a
regular manufacturer of paradoxes.</p>

<p class='c013'>The greatest number of minds seem utterly incapable of fixing on
any conclusion, except from the pressure of custom and authority:
opposed to these, there is another class less numerous but pretty
formidable, who in all their opinions are equally under the influence
of novelty and restless vanity. The prejudices of the one are
counter-balanced by the paradoxes of the other; and folly, ‘putting
in one scale a weight of ignorance, in that of pride,’ might be said
to ‘smile delighted with the eternal poise.’ A sincere and manly
spirit of inquiry is neither blinded by example nor dazzled by sudden
flashes of light. Nature is always the same, the store-house of lasting
truth, and teeming with inexhaustible variety; and he who looks at
her with steady and well-practised eyes, will find enough to employ
all his sagacity, whether it has or has not been seen by others before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>him. Strange as it may seem, to learn what any object is, the true
philosopher looks at the object itself, instead of turning to others to
know what they think or say or have heard of it, or instead of consulting
the dictates of his vanity, petulance, and ingenuity, to see what
can be said against their opinion, and to prove himself wiser than all
the rest of the world. For want of this, the real powers and
resources of the mind are lost and dissipated in a conflict of opinions
and passions, of obstinacy against levity, of bigotry against self-conceit,
of notorious abuses against rash innovations, of dull, plodding,
old-fashioned stupidity against new-fangled folly, of worldly interest
against headstrong egotism, of the incorrigible prejudices of the old
and the unmanageable humours of the young; while truth lies in the
middle, and is overlooked by both parties. Or as Luther complained
long ago, ‘human reason is like a drunken man on horseback: set it
up on one side, and it tumbles over on the other.’—With one sort,
example, authority, fashion, ease, interest, rule all: with the other,
singularity, the love of distinction, mere whim, the throwing off all
restraint and showing an heroic disregard of consequences, an impatient
and unsettled turn of mind, the want of sudden and strong
excitement, of some new play-thing for the imagination, are equally
‘lords of the ascendant,’ and are at every step getting the start of
reason, truth, nature, common sense and feeling. With one party,
whatever is, is right: with their antagonists, whatever is, is wrong.
These swallow every antiquated absurdity: those catch at every new,
unfledged project—and are alike enchanted with the velocipedes or
the French Revolution. One set, wrapped up in impenetrable forms
and technical traditions, are deaf to every thing that has not been
dinned in their ears, and in those of their forefathers, from time
immemorial: their hearing is <em>thick</em> with the same old saws, the same
unmeaning form of words, everlastingly repeated: the others pique
themselves on a jargon of their own, a Babylonish dialect, crude,
unconcocted, harsh, discordant, to which it is impossible for any
one else to attach either meaning or respect. These last turn away
at the mention of all usages, creeds, institutions of more than a day’s
standing as a mass of bigotry, superstition, and barbarous ignorance,
whose leaden touch would petrify and benumb their quick, mercurial,
‘apprehensive, forgetive’ faculties. The opinion of to-day supersedes
that of yesterday: that of to-morrow supersedes by anticipation that
of to-day. The wisdom of the ancients, the doctrines of the learned,
the laws of nations, the common sentiments of mortality, are to them
like a bundle of old almanacs. As the modern politician always
asks for this day’s paper, the modern sciolist always inquires after
the latest paradox. With him instinct is a dotard, nature a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>changeling, and common sense a discarded bye-word. As with
the man of the world, what every body says must be true, the
citizen of the world has a quite different notion of the matter.
With the one the majority, ‘the powers that be,’ have always been
in the right in all ages and places, though they have been cutting
one another’s throats and turning the world upside down with their
quarrels and disputes from the beginning of time: with the other,
what any two people have ever agreed in, is an error on the face
of it. The credulous bigot shudders at the idea of altering any
thing in ‘time-hallowed’ institutions; and under this cant-phrase
can bring himself to tolerate any knavery, or any folly, the Inquisition,
Holy Oil, the Right Divine, &amp;c. The more refined sceptic
will laugh in your face at the idea of retaining any thing which has
the damning stamp of custom upon it, and is for abating all former
precedents, ‘all trivial, fond records,’ the whole frame and fabric
of society as a nuisance in the lump. Is not this a pair of wiseacres
well-matched? The one stickles through thick and thin for his
own religion and government: the other scouts all religions and
all governments with a smile of ineffable disdain. The one will
not move for any consideration out of the broad and beaten path:
the other is continually turning off at right angles, and losing himself
in the labyrinths of his own ignorance and presumption. The
one will not go along with any party; the other always joins the
strongest side. The one will not conform to any common practice;
the other will subscribe to any thriving system. The one is the
slave of habit, the other is the sport of caprice. The first is like
a man obstinately bed-rid: the last is troubled with St. Vitus’s
dance. He cannot stand still, he cannot rest upon any conclusion.
‘He never is—but always to be <em>right</em>.’</p>

<p class='c013'>The author of the Prometheus Unbound (to take an individual
instance of the last character) has a fire in his eye, a fever in his
blood, a maggot in his brain, a hectic flutter in his speech, which
mark out the philosophic fanatic. He is sanguine-complexioned,
and shrill-voiced. As is often observable in the case of religious
enthusiasts, there is a slenderness of constitutional <em>stamina</em>, which
renders the flesh no match for the spirit. His bending, flexible
form appears to take no strong hold of things, does not grapple with
the world about him, but slides from it like a river—</p>

<p class='c015'>The shock of accident, the weight of authority make no impression
on his opinions, which retire like a feather, or rise from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>encounter unhurt, through their own buoyancy. He is clogged by
no dull system of realities, no earth-bound feelings, no rooted
prejudices, by nothing that belongs to the mighty trunk and hard
husk of nature and habit, but is drawn up by irresistible levity to
the regions of mere speculation and fancy, to the sphere of air and
fire, where his delighted spirit floats in ‘seas of pearl and clouds
of amber.’ There is no <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i> of worn-out, thread-bare
experience to serve as ballast to his mind; it is all volatile
intellectual salt of tartar, that refuses to combine its evanescent,
inflammable essence with any thing solid or any thing lasting.
Bubbles are to him the only realities:—touch them, and they vanish.
Curiosity is the only proper category of his mind, and though a
man in knowledge, he is a child in feeling. Hence he puts every
thing into a metaphysical crucible to judge of it himself and exhibit
it to others as a subject of interesting experiment, without first
making it over to the ordeal of his common sense or trying it on
his heart. This faculty of speculating at random on all questions
may in its overgrown and uninformed state do much mischief without
intending it, like an overgrown child with the power of a man.
Mr. Shelley has been accused of vanity—I think he is chargeable
with extreme levity; but this levity is so great, that I do not believe
he is sensible of its consequences. He strives to overturn all
established creeds and systems: but this is in him an effect of constitution.
He runs before the most extravagant opinions, but this
is because he is held back by none of the merely mechanical checks
of sympathy and habit. He tampers with all sorts of obnoxious
subjects, but it is less because he is gratified with the rankness of
the taint, than captivated with the intellectual phosphoric light they
emit. It would seem that he wished not so much to convince or
inform as to shock the public by the tenor of his productions, but
I suspect he is more intent upon startling himself with his electrical
experiments in morals and philosophy; and though they may scorch
other people, they are to him harmless amusements, the coruscations
of an Aurora Borealis, that ‘play round the head, but do not reach
the heart.’ Still I could wish that he would put a stop to the
incessant, alarming whirl of his Voltaic battery. With his zeal,
his talent, and his fancy, he would do more good and less harm,
if he were to give up his wilder theories, and if he took less pleasure
in feeling his heart flutter in unison with the panic-struck apprehensions
of his readers. Persons of this class, instead of consolidating
useful and acknowledged truths, and thus advancing the
cause of science and virtue, are never easy but in raising doubtful
and disagreeable questions, which bring the former into disgrace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>and discredit. They are not contented to lead the minds of men
to an eminence overlooking the prospect of social amelioration,
unless, by forcing them up slippery paths and to the utmost verge of
possibility, they can dash them down the precipice the instant they
reach the promised Pisgah. They think it nothing to hang up a
beacon to guide or warn, if they do not at the same time frighten
the community like a comet. They do not mind making their
principles odious, provided they can make themselves notorious.
To win over the public opinion by fair means is to them an insipid,
common-place mode of popularity: they would either force it by
harsh methods, or seduce it by intoxicating potions. Egotism,
petulance, licentiousness, levity of principle (whatever be the source)
is a bad thing in any one, and most of all, in a philosophical reformer.
Their humanity, their wisdom is always ‘at the horizon.’
Any thing new, any thing remote, any thing questionable, comes
to them in a shape that is sure of a cordial welcome—a welcome
cordial in proportion as the object is new, as it is apparently impracticable,
as it is a doubt whether it is at all desirable. Just after
the final failure, the completion of the last act of the French Revolution,
when the legitimate wits were crying out, ‘The farce is over,
now let us go to supper,’ these provoking reasoners got up a lively
hypothesis about introducing the domestic government of the Nayrs
into this country as a feasible set-off against the success of the
Boroughmongers. The practical is with them always the antipodes
of the ideal; and like other visionaries of a different stamp, they
date the Millennium or New Order of Things from the Restoration
of the Bourbons. Fine words butter no parsnips, says the proverb.
‘While you are talking of marrying, I am thinking of hanging,’ says
Captain Macheath. Of all people the most tormenting are those
who bid you hope in the midst of despair, who, by never caring
about any thing but their own sanguine, hair-brained Utopian
schemes, have at no time any particular cause for embarrassment
and despondency because they have never the least chance of success,
and who by including whatever does not hit their idle fancy, kings,
priests, religion, government, public abuses or private morals, in the
same sweeping clause of ban and anathema, do all they can to
combine all parties in a common cause against them, and to prevent
every one else from advancing one step farther in the career of
practical improvement than they do in that of imaginary and unattainable
perfection.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, all this untoward heat and precocity often argues rottenness
and a falling-off. I myself remember several instances of this
sort of unrestrained licence of opinion and violent effervescence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>sentiment in the first period of the French Revolution. Extremes
meet: and the most furious anarchists have since become the most
barefaced apostates. Among the foremost of these I might mention
the present poet-laureate and some of his friends. The prose-writers
on that side of the question, Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bentham, &amp;c. have
not turned round in this extraordinary manner: they seem to
have felt their ground (however mistaken in some points) and have
in general adhered to their first principles. But ‘poets (as it has
been said) have <em>such seething brains</em>, that they are disposed to meddle
with every thing, and mar all. They make bad philosophers and
worse politicians.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a> They live, for the most part, in an ideal world
of their own; and it would perhaps be as well if they were confined
to it. Their flights and fancies are delightful to themselves and
to everybody else: but they make strange work with matter of fact;
and if they were allowed to act in public affairs, would soon turn the
world the wrong side out. They indulge only their own flattering
dreams or superstitious prejudices, and make idols or bugbears of
whatever they please, caring as little for history or particular facts as
for general reasoning. They are dangerous leaders and treacherous
followers. Their inordinate vanity runs them into all sorts of extravagances;
and their habitual effeminacy gets them out of them at any
price. Always pampering their own appetite for excitement, and
wishing to astonish others, their whole aim is to produce a dramatic
effect, one way or other—to shock or delight the observers; and they
are apparently as indifferent to the consequences of what they write,
as if the world were merely a stage for them to play their fantastic
tricks on, and to make their admirers weep. Not less romantic in
their servility than their independence, and equally importunate candidates
for fame or infamy, they require only to be distinguished, and
are not scrupulous as to the means of distinction. Jacobins or Anti-Jacobins—outrageous
advocates for anarchy and licentiousness, or
flaming apostles of political persecution—always violent and vulgar in
their opinions, they oscillate, with a giddy and sickening motion, from
one absurdity to another, and expiate the follies of youth by the heartless
vices of advancing age. None so ready as they to carry every
paradox to its most revolting and ridiculous excess—none so sure to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>caricature, in their own persons, every feature of the prevailing philosophy!
In their days of blissful innovation, indeed, the philosophers
crept at their heels like hounds, while they darted on their distant
quarry like hawks; stooping always to the lowest game; eagerly
snuffing up the most tainted and rankest scents; feeding their vanity
with a notion of the strength of their digestion of poisons, and most
ostentatiously avowing whatever would most effectually startle the
prejudices of others.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Preposterously seeking for the stimulus of
novelty in abstract truth, and the eclat of theatrical exhibition in pure
reason, it is no wonder that these persons at last became disgusted
with their own pursuits, and that in consequence of the violence of
the change, the most inveterate prejudices and uncharitable sentiments
have rushed in to fill up the void produced by the previous annihilation
of common sense, wisdom, and humanity!’</p>

<p class='c013'>I have so far been a little hard on poets and reformers. Lest I
should be thought to have taken a particular spite to them, I will try
to make them the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende honourable</span></i> by turning to a passage in the
writings of one who neither is nor ever pretended to be a poet or a
reformer, but the antithesis of both, an accomplished man of the world,
a courtier, and a wit, and who has endeavoured to move the previous
question on all schemes of fanciful improvement, and all plans of
practical reform, by the following declaration. It is in itself a
finished <em>common-place</em>; and may serve as a test whether that sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>smooth, verbal reasoning which passes current because it excites no
one idea in the mind, is much freer from inherent absurdity than the
wildest paradox.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘My lot,’ says Mr. Canning in the conclusion of the Liverpool
speech, ‘is cast under the British Monarchy. Under that I have
lived; under that I have seen my country flourish;<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> under that I
have seen it enjoy as great a share of prosperity, of happiness, and of
glory, as I believe any modification of human society to be capable of
bestowing; and I am not prepared to sacrifice or to hazard the fruit
of centuries of experience, of centuries of struggles, and of more than
one century of liberty, as perfect as ever blessed any country upon the
earth, for visionary schemes of ideal perfectibility, for doubtful experiments
even of possible improvement.’—<cite>Mr. Canning’s Speech at the
Liverpool Dinner, given in celebration of his Re-election, March 18,
1820. Fourth Edition, revised and corrected.</cite></p>

<p class='c013'>Such is Mr. Canning’s common-place; and in giving the following
answer to it, I do not think I can be accused of falling into that
extravagant and unmitigated strain of paradoxical reasoning, with
which I have already found so much fault.</p>

<p class='c013'>The passage then which the gentleman here throws down as an effectual
bar to all change, to all innovation, to all improvement, contains
at every step a refutation of his favourite creed. He is not ‘prepared
to sacrifice or to hazard the fruit of centuries of experience, of centuries
of struggles, and of one century of liberty, for visionary
schemes of ideal perfectibility.’ So here are centuries of experience
and centuries of struggles to arrive at <em>one century of liberty</em>; and
yet according to Mr. Canning’s general advice, we are never to make
any experiments or to engage in any struggles either with a view to
future improvement, or to recover benefits which we have lost. Man
(they repeat it in our ears, line upon line, precept upon precept) is
always to turn his back upon the future, and his face to the past.
He is to believe that nothing is possible or desirable but what he finds
already established to his hands in time worn institutions or inveterate
abuses. His understanding is to be buried in implicit creeds, and he
himself is to be made into a political automaton, a go-cart of superstition
and prejudice, never stirring hand or foot but as he is pulled by
the wires and strings of the state-conjurors, the legitimate managers
and proprietors of the shew. His powers of will, of thought, and
action are to be paralysed in him, and he is to be told and to believe
that whatever is, must be. Perhaps Mr. Canning will say that men
were to make experiments, and to resolve upon struggles formerly,
but that now they are to surrender their understandings and their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>rights into his keeping. But at what period of the world was the
system of political wisdom <em>stereotyped</em>, like Mr. Cobbett’s ‘Gold
against Paper,’ so as to admit of no further alterations or improvements,
or correction of errors of the press? When did the experience
of mankind become stationary or retrograde, so that we must act
from the obsolete inferences of past periods, not from the living
impulse of existing circumstances, and the consolidated force of the
knowledge and reflection of ages up to the present instant, naturally
projecting us forward into the future, and not driving us back upon the
past? Did Mr. Canning never hear, did he never think, of Lord
Bacon’s axiom, ‘That those times are the ancient times in which we
live, and not those which counting backwards from ourselves, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ordine
retrogrado</span></i>, we call ancient?’ The latest periods must necessarily
have the advantage of the sum-total of the experience that has gone
before them, and of the sum-total of human reason exerted upon that
experience, or upon the solid foundation of nature and history,
moving on in its majestic course, not fluttering in the empty air of
fanciful speculation, nor leaving a gap of centuries between us and the
long-mouldered grounds on which we are to think and act. Mr.
Canning cannot plead with Mr. Burke that no discoveries, no improvements
have been made in political science and institutions; for
he says we have arrived through centuries of experience and of
struggles at one century of liberty. Is the world then at a stand?
Mr. Canning knows well enough that it is in ceaseless progress and
everlasting change, but he would have it to be the change from liberty
to slavery, the progress of corruption, not of regeneration and reform.
Why, no longer ago than the present year, the two epochs of November
and January last presented (he tells us in this very speech) as
great a contrast in the state of the country as any two periods of its
history the most opposite or most remote. Well then, are our
experience and our struggles at an end? No, he says, ‘the crisis is
at hand for every man to take part for, or against the institutions of
the British Monarchy.’ His part is taken: ‘but of this be sure, to
do aught good will never be his task!’ He will guard carefully
against all possible improvements, and maintain all possible abuses
sacred, impassive, immortal. He will not give up the fruit of centuries
of experience, of struggles, and of one century at least of
liberty, since the Revolution of 1688, for any doubtful experiments
whatever. We are arrived at the end of our experience, our
struggles, and our liberty—and are to anchor through time and
eternity in the harbour of passive obedience and non-resistance.
We (the people of England) will tell Mr. Canning frankly what
we think of his magnanimous and ulterior resolution. It is our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>own; and it has been the resolution of mankind in all ages of
the world. No people, no age, ever threw away the fruits of
past wisdom, or the enjoyment of present blessings, for visionary
schemes of ideal perfection. It is the knowledge of the past,
the actual infliction of the present, that has produced all changes,
all innovations, and all improvements—not (as is pretended) the
chimerical anticipation of possible advantages, but the intolerable
pressure of long-established, notorious, aggravated, and growing
abuses. It was the experience of the enormous and disgusting
abuses and corruptions of the Papal power that produced the
Reformation. It was the experience of the vexations and oppressions
of the feudal system that produced its abolition after centuries
of sufferings and of struggles. It was the experience of the caprice
and tyranny of the Monarch that extorted <cite>Magna Charta</cite> at Runnymede.
It was the experience of the arbitrary and insolent abuse of
the prerogative in the reigns of the Tudors and the first Stuarts that
produced the resistance to it in the reign of Charles I. and the Grand
Rebellion. It was the experience of the incorrigible attachment of
the same Stuarts to Popery and Slavery, with their many acts of
cruelty, treachery, and bigotry, that produced the Revolution, and
set the House of Brunswick on the Throne. It was the conviction
of the incurable nature of the abuse, increasing with time and patience,
and overcoming the obstinate attachment to old habits and prejudices,
an attachment not to be rooted out by fancy or theory, but only by
repeated, lasting, and incontrovertible proofs, that has abated every
nuisance that ever was abated, and introduced every innovation and
every example of revolution and reform. It was the experience of
the abuses, licentiousness, and innumerable oppressions of the old
Government in France that produced the French Revolution. It
was the experience of the determination of the British Ministry to
harass, insult, and plunder them, that produced the Revolution of the
United States. Away then with this miserable cant against fanciful
theories, and appeal to acknowledged experience! Men never act
against their prejudices but from the spur of their feelings, the
necessity of their situations—their theories are adapted to their
practical convictions and their varying circumstances. Nature has
ordered it so, and Mr. Canning, by shewing off his rhetorical paces,
by his ‘ambling and lisping and nicknaming God’s creatures,’ cannot
invert that order, efface the history of the past, or arrest the progress
of the future.—Public opinion is the result of public events and public
feelings; and government must be moulded by that opinion, or
maintain itself in opposition to it by the sword. Mr. Canning indeed
will not consent that the social machine should in any case receive a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>different direction from what it has had, ‘lest it should be hurried
over the precipice and dashed to pieces.’ These warnings of national
ruin and terrific accounts of political precipices put one in mind of
Edgar’s exaggerations to Gloster: they make one’s hair stand on end
in the perusal; but the poor old man, like poor Old England, could
fall no lower than he was. Mr. Montgomery, the ingenious and
amiable poet, after he had been shut up in solitary confinement for a
year and a half for printing the Duke of Richmond’s Letter on
Reform, when he first walked out into the narrow path of the
adjoining field, was seized with an apprehension that he should fall
over it, as if he had trod on the brink of an abrupt declivity. The
author of the loyal Speech at the Liverpool Dinner has been so long
kept in the solitary confinement of his prejudices, and the dark cells
of his interest and vanity, that he is afraid of being dashed to pieces
if he makes a single false step, to the right or the left, from his
dangerous and crooked policy. As to himself, his ears are no doubt
closed to any advice that might here be offered him; and as to his
country, he seems bent on its destruction. If, however, an example
of the futility of all his projects and all his reasonings on a broader
scale, ‘to warn and scare, be wanting,’ let him look at Spain, and
take leisure to recover from his incredulity and his surprise. Spain,
as Ferdinand, as the Monarchy, has fallen from its pernicious height,
never to rise again: Spain, as Spain, as the Spanish people, has risen
from the tomb of liberty, never (it is to be hoped) to sink again
under the yoke of the bigot and the oppressor!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XVI<br /> <span class='small'>ON VULGARITY AND AFFECTATION</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>Few subjects are more nearly allied than these two—vulgarity and
affectation. It may be said of them truly that ‘thin partitions do
their bounds divide.’ There cannot be a surer proof of a low origin
or of an innate meanness of disposition, than to be always talking and
thinking of being genteel. One must feel a strong tendency to that
which one is always trying to avoid: whenever we pretend, on all
occasions, a mighty contempt for any thing, it is a pretty clear sign
that we feel ourselves very nearly on a level with it. Of the two
classes of people, I hardly know which is to be regarded with most
distaste, the vulgar aping the genteel, or the genteel constantly
sneering at and endeavouring to distinguish themselves from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>vulgar. These two sets of persons are always thinking of one
another; the lower of the higher with envy, the more fortunate of
their less happy neighbours with contempt. They are habitually
placed in opposition to each other; jostle in their pretensions at every
turn; and the same objects and train of thought (only reversed by the
relative situation of either party) occupy their whole time and attention.
The one are straining every nerve, and outraging common
sense, to be thought genteel; the others have no other object or idea
in their heads than not to be thought vulgar. This is but poor spite;
a very pitiful style of ambition. To be merely not that which one
heartily despises, is a very humble claim to superiority: to despise
what one really is, is still worse. Most of the characters in Miss
Burney’s novels, the Branghtons, the Smiths, the Dubsters, the
Cecilias, the Delvilles, &amp;c. are well met in this respect, and much of
a piece: the one half are trying not to be taken for themselves, and
the other half not to be taken for the first. They neither of them
have any pretensions of their own, or real standard of worth. ‘A
feather will turn the scale of their avoirdupois:’ though the fair
authoress was not aware of the metaphysical identity of her principal
and subordinate characters. Affectation is the master-key to both.</p>

<p class='c013'>Gentility is only a more select and artificial kind of vulgarity. It
cannot exist but by a sort of borrowed distinction. It plumes itself
up and revels in the homely pretensions of the mass of mankind. It
judges of the worth of everything by name, fashion, opinion; and
hence, from the conscious absence of real qualities or sincere satisfaction
in itself, it builds its supercilious and fantastic conceit on the
wretchedness and wants of others. Violent antipathies are always
suspicious, and betray a secret affinity. The difference between the
‘Great Vulgar and the Small’ is mostly in outward circumstances.
The coxcomb criticises the dress of the clown, as the pedant cavils
at the bad grammar of the illiterate, or the prude is shocked at the
backslidings of her frail acquaintance. Those who have the fewest
resources in themselves, naturally seek the food of their self-love
elsewhere. The most ignorant people find most to laugh at in
strangers: scandal and satire prevail most in country-places; and a
propensity to ridicule every the slightest or most palpable deviation
from what we happen to approve, ceases with the progress of common
sense and decency.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> True worth does not exult in the faults and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>deficiencies of others; as true refinement turns away from grossness
and deformity, instead of being tempted to indulge in an unmanly
triumph over it. Raphael would not faint away at the daubing of a
sign-post, nor Homer hold his head the higher for being in the
company of a Grub-street bard. Real power, real excellence, does
not seek for a foil in inferiority; nor fear contamination from coming
in contact with that which is coarse and homely. It reposes on
itself, and is equally free from spleen and affectation. But the spirit
of gentility is the mere essence of spleen and affectation;—of affected
delight in its own <em>would-be</em> qualifications, and of ineffable disdain
poured out upon the involuntary blunders or accidental disadvantages
of those whom it chooses to treat as its inferiors. Thus a fashionable
Miss titters till she is ready to burst her sides at the uncouth shape of
a bonnet, or the abrupt drop of a courtesy (such as Jeanie Deans
would make) in a country-girl who comes to be hired by her Mamma
as a servant:—yet to shew how little foundation there is for this
hysterical expression of her extreme good opinion of herself and
contempt for the untutored rustic, she would herself the next day be
delighted with the very same shaped bonnet if brought her by a
French milliner and told it was all the fashion, and in a week’s time
will become quite familiar with the maid, and chatter with her (upon
equal terms) about caps and ribbons and lace by the hour together.
There is no difference between them but that of situation in the
kitchen or in the parlour: let circumstances bring them together, and
they fit like hand and glove. It is like mistress, like maid. Their
talk, their thoughts, their dreams, their likings and dislikes are the
same. The mistress’s head runs continually on dress and finery, so
does the maid’s: the young lady longs to ride in a coach and six, so
does the maid, if she could: Miss forms a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau idéal</span></i> of a lover with
black eyes and rosy cheeks, which does not differ from that of her
attendant: both like a smart man, the one the footman and the other
his master, for the same reason: both like handsome furniture and
fine houses: both apply the terms, <em>shocking</em> and <em>disagreeable</em>, to the
same things and persons: both have a great notion of balls, plays,
treats, song-books and love-tales: both like a wedding or a christening,
and both would give their little fingers to see a coronation, with this
difference, that the one has a chance of getting a seat at it, and the
other is dying of envy that she has not. Indeed, this last is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>ceremony that delights equally the greatest monarch and the meanest
of his subjects—the vilest of the rabble. Yet this, which is the
height of gentility and the consummation of external distinction and
splendour, is, I should say, a vulgar ceremony. For what degree of
refinement, of capacity, of virtue is required in the individual who is
so distinguished, or is necessary to his enjoying this idle and imposing
parade of his person? Is he delighted with the state-coach and
gilded pannels? So is the poorest wretch that gazes at it. Is he
struck with the spirit, the beauty and symmetry of the eight cream-coloured
horses? There is not one of the immense multitude, who
flock to see the sight from town or country, St. Giles’s or Whitechapel,
young or old, rich or poor, gentle or simple, who does not
agree to admire the same object. Is he delighted with the yeomen
of the guard, the military escort, the groups of ladies, the badges of
sovereign power, the kingly crown, the marshal’s truncheon and the
judge’s robe, the array that precedes and follows him, the crowded
streets, the windows hung with eager looks? So are the mob, for
they ‘have eyes and see them!’ There is no one faculty of mind or
body, natural or acquired, essential to the principal figure in this
procession, more than is common to the meanest and most despised
attendant on it. A wax-work figure would answer the same purpose:
a Lord Mayor of London has as much tinsel to be proud of.
I would rather have a king do something that no one else has the
power or magnanimity to do, or say something that no one else has
the wisdom to say, or look more handsome, more thoughtful, or
benign than any one else in his dominions. But I see nothing to
raise one’s idea of him in his being made a shew of: if the pageant
would do as well without the man, the man would do as well without
the pageant! Kings have been declared to be ‘lovers of low
company:’ and this maxim, besides the reason sometimes assigned
for it, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> that they meet with less opposition to their wills from such
persons, will I suspect be found to turn at last on the consideration
I am here stating, that they also meet with more sympathy in their
tastes. The most ignorant and thoughtless have the greatest admiration
of the baubles, the outward symbols of pomp and power, the
sound and shew, which are the habitual delight and mighty prerogative
of kings. The stupidest slave worships the gaudiest tyrant. The
same gross motives appeal to the same gross capacities, flatter the
pride of the superior, and excite the servility of the dependant:
whereas a higher reach of moral and intellectual refinement might
seek in vain for higher proofs of internal worth and inherent majesty
in the object of its idolatry, and not finding the divinity lodged
within, the unreasonable expectation raised would probably end in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>mortification on both sides!—There is little to distinguish a king
from his subjects but the rabble’s shout—if he loses that, and is
reduced to the forlorn hope of gaining the suffrages of the wise and
good, he is of all men the most miserable.—But enough of this.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I like it,’ says Miss Branghton<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a> in Evelina (meaning the Opera)
‘because it is not vulgar.’ That is, she likes it, not because there is
any thing to like in it, but because other people are prevented from
liking or knowing any thing about it. Janus Weathercock, Esq.
laugheth to scorn and spitefully entreateth and hugely condemneth my
dramatic criticisms in the London, for a like exquisite reason.
I must therefore make an example of him <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in terrorem</span></i> to all such
hypercritics. He finds fault with me and calls my taste vulgar,
because I go to Sadler’s Wells (‘a place he has heard of’—O Lord,
Sir!)—because I notice the Miss Dennets, ‘great favourites with the
Whitechapel orders’—praise Miss Valancy, ‘a bouncing Columbine
at Ashley’s and them there places, as his barber informs him,’ (has
he no way of establishing himself in his own good opinion but by
triumphing over his barber’s bad English?)—and finally, because
I recognise the existence of the Cobourg and the Surrey theatres, at
the names of which he cries ‘Faugh’ with great significance, as if he
had some personal disgust at them, and yet he would be supposed
never to have entered them. It is not his cue as a well-bred critic.
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est beau ça.</span></i> Now this appears to me a very crude, unmeaning,
indiscriminate, wholesale and vulgar way of thinking. It is prejudging
things in the lump, by names and places and classes, instead
of judging of them by what they are in themselves, by their real
qualities and shades of distinction. There is no selection, truth, or
delicacy in such a mode of proceeding. It is affecting ignorance,
and making it a title to wisdom. It is a vapid assumption of
superiority. It is exceeding impertinence. It is rank coxcombry.
It is nothing in the world else. To condemn because the multitude
admire is as essentially vulgar as to admire because they admire.
There is no exercise of taste or judgment in either case: both are
equally repugnant to good sense, and of the two I should prefer the
good-natured side. I would as soon agree with my barber as differ
from him: and why should I make a point of reversing the sentence
of the Whitechapel orders? Or how can it affect my opinion of the
merits of an actor at the Cobourg or the Surrey theatres, that these
theatres are in or out of the Bills of Mortality? This is an easy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>short-hand way of judging, as gross as it is mechanical. It is not a
difficult matter to settle questions of taste by consulting the map of
London, or to prove your liberality by geographical distinctions.
Janus jumbles things together strangely. If he had seen Mr. Kean in
a provincial theatre, at Exeter or Taunton, he would have thought it
vulgar to admire him: but when he had been stamped in London,
Janus would no doubt shew his discernment and the subtlety of his
tact for the display of character and passion, by not being behind the
fashion. The Miss Dennetts are ‘little unformed girls,’ for no other
reason than because they danced at one of the Minor Theatres: let
them but come out on the Opera boards, and let the beauty and
fashion of the season greet them with a fairy shower of delighted
applause, and they would outshine Milanie ‘with the foot of fire.’
His gorge rises at the mention of a certain quarter of the town:
whatever passes current in another, he ‘swallows total grist unsifted,
husks and all.’ This is not taste, but folly. At this rate, the
hackney-coachman who drives him, or his horse Contributor, whom
he has introduced as a select personage to the vulgar reader, knows
as much of the matter as he does. In a word, the answer to all this
in the first instance is to say what vulgarity is. Now its essence, I
imagine, consists in taking manners, actions, words, opinions on trust
from others, without examining one’s own feelings or weighing the
merits of the case. It is coarseness or shallowness of taste arising
from want of individual refinement, together with the confidence and
presumption inspired by example and numbers. It may be defined to
be a prostitution of the mind or body to ape the more or less obvious
defects of others, because by so doing we shall secure the suffrages
of those we associate with. To affect a gesture, an opinion, a phrase,
because it is the rage with a large number of persons, or to hold it in
abhorrence because another set of persons very little, if at all, better
informed, cry it down to distinguish themselves from the former, is in
either case equal vulgarity and absurdity. A thing is not vulgar
merely because it is common. ’Tis common to breathe, to see, to
feel, to live. Nothing is vulgar that is natural, spontaneous, unavoidable.
Grossness is not vulgarity, ignorance is not vulgarity, awkwardness
is not vulgarity: but all these become vulgar when they are
affected and shewn off on the authority of others, or to fall in with
<em>the fashion</em> or the company we keep. Caliban is coarse enough, but
surely he is not vulgar. We might as well spurn the clod under our
feet, and call it vulgar. Cobbett is coarse enough, but he is not
vulgar. He does not belong to the herd. Nothing real, nothing
original can be vulgar: but I should think an imitator of Cobbett a
vulgar man. Emery’s Yorkshireman is vulgar, because he is a Yorkshireman.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>It is the cant and gibberish, the cunning and low life of a
particular district; it has ‘a stamp exclusive and provincial.’ He
might ‘gabble most brutishly’ and yet not fall under the letter of the
definition: but ‘his speech bewrayeth him,’ his dialect (like the jargon
of a Bond-street lounger) is the damning circumstance. If he were
a mere blockhead, it would not signify: but he thinks himself a
<em>knowing hand</em>, according to the notions and practices of those with
whom he was brought up, and which he thinks <em>the go</em> every where.
In a word, this character is not the offspring of untutored nature but
of bad habits; it is made up of ignorance and conceit. It has a
mixture of <em>slang</em> in it. All slang phrases are for the same reason
vulgar; but there is nothing vulgar in the common English idiom.
Simplicity is not vulgarity; but the looking to affectation of any sort
for distinction is. A cockney is a vulgar character, whose imagination
cannot wander beyond the suburbs of the metropolis: so is a fellow
who is always thinking of the High-street, Edinburgh. We want a
name for this last character. An opinion is vulgar that is stewed in
the rank breath of the rabble: nor is it a bit purer or more refined for
having passed through the well cleansed teeth of a whole court. The
inherent vulgarity is in having no other feeling on any subject than
the crude, blind, headlong, gregarious notion acquired by sympathy
with the mixed multitude or with a fastidious minority, who are just
as insensible to the real truth, and as indifferent to every thing but
their own frivolous and vexatious pretensions. The upper are not
wiser than the lower orders, because they resolve to differ from them.
The fashionable have the advantage of the unfashionable in nothing
but the fashion. The true vulgar are the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">servum pecus imitatorum</span></i>—the
herd of pretenders to what they do not feel and to what is not
natural to them, whether in high or low life. To belong to any class,
to move in any rank or sphere of life, is not a very exclusive distinction
or test of refinement. Refinement will in all classes be the
exception, not the rule; and the exception may fall out in one class
as well as another. A king is but an hereditary title. A nobleman
is only one of the House of Peers. To be a knight or alderman is
confessedly a vulgar thing. The king the other day made Sir Walter
Scott a baronet, but not all the power of the Three Estates could
make another Author of Waverley. Princes, heroes are often
common-place people: Hamlet was not a vulgar character, neither
was Don Quixote. To be an author, to be a painter, is nothing. It
is a trick, it is a trade.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Nay, to be a Member of the Royal Academy, or a Fellow of the
Royal Society, is but a vulgar distinction. But to be a Virgil, a
Milton, a Raphael, a Claude, is what fell to the lot of humanity but
once! I do not think <em>they</em> were vulgar people, though for any thing
I know to the contrary, the first Lord of the Bed-chamber may be a
very vulgar man: for anything I know to the contrary, he may not
be so.—Such are pretty much my notions of gentility and vulgarity.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a well-dressed and an ill-dressed mob, both which I hate.
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odi profanum vulgus, et arceo.</span></i> The vapid affectation of the one is to
me even more intolerable than the gross insolence and brutality of the
other. If a set of low-lived fellows are noisy, rude, and boisterous
to shew their disregard of the company, a set of fashionable coxcombs
are, to a nauseous degree, finical and effeminate to shew their thorough
breeding. The one are governed by their feelings, however coarse
and misguided, which is something: the others consult only appearances,
which are nothing, either as a test of happiness or virtue.
Hogarth in his prints has trimmed the balance of pretension between
the downright blackguard and the <em>soi-disant</em> fine gentleman unanswerably.
It does not appear in his moral demonstrations (whatever it
may do in the genteel letter-writing of Lord Chesterfield, or the
chivalrous rhapsodies of Burke) that vice by losing all its grossness
loses half its evil. It becomes more contemptible, not less disgusting.
What is there in common, for instance, between his beaux and belles,
his rakes and his coquets, and the men and women, the true heroic
and ideal characters in Raphael? But his people of fashion and
quality are just upon a par with the low, the selfish, the <em>unideal</em>
characters in the contrasted view of human life, and are often the very
same characters, only changing places. If the lower ranks are actuated
by envy and uncharitableness towards the upper, the latter have
scarcely any feelings but of pride, contempt, and aversion to the
lower. If the poor would pull down the rich to get at their good
things, the rich would tread down the poor as in a vine-press, and
squeeze the last shilling out of their pockets, and the last drop of
blood out of their veins. If the headstrong self-will and unruly
turbulence of a common alehouse are shocking, what shall we say to
the studied insincerity, the insipid want of common sense, the callous
insensibility of the drawing-room and <em>boudoir</em>? I would rather see
the feelings of our common nature (for they are the same at bottom)
expressed in the most naked and unqualified way, than see every
feeling of our nature suppressed, stifled, hermetically sealed under the
smooth, cold, glittering varnish of pretended refinement and conventional
politeness. The one may be corrected by being better informed;
the other is incorrigible, wilful, heartless depravity. I cannot describe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the contempt and disgust I have felt at the tone of what would be
thought good company, when I have witnessed the sleek, smiling,
glossy, gratuitous assumption of superiority to every feeling of humanity,
honesty, or principle, as a part of the etiquette, the mental and
moral <em>costume</em> of the table, and every profession of toleration or favour
for the lower orders, that is, for the great mass of our fellow-creatures,
treated as an indecorum and breach of the harmony of well-regulated
society. In short, I prefer a bear-garden to the adder’s den. Or
to put this case in its extremest point of view, I have more patience
with men in a rude state of nature outraging the human form, than
I have with apes ‘making mops and mows’ at the extravagances
they have first provoked. I can endure the brutality (as it is termed)
of mobs better than the inhumanity of courts. The violence of the
one rages like a fire; the insidious policy of the other strikes like a
pestilence, and is more fatal and inevitable. The slow poison of
despotism is worse than the convulsive struggles of anarchy. ‘Of all
evils,’ says Hume, ‘anarchy is the shortest lived.’ The one may
‘break out like a wild overthrow;’ but the other from its secret,
sacred stand, operates unseen, and undermines the happiness of kingdoms
for ages, lurks in the hollow cheek, and stares you in the face
in the ghastly eye of want and agony and woe. It is dreadful to
hear the noise and uproar of an infuriated multitude stung by the
sense of wrong, and maddened by sympathy: it is more appalling to
think of the smile answered by other gracious smiles, of the whisper
echoed by other assenting whispers, which doom them first to despair
and then to destruction. Popular fury finds its counterpart in courtly
servility. If every outrage is to be apprehended from the one, every
iniquity is deliberately sanctioned by the other, without regard to
justice or decency. The word of a king, ‘Go thou and do likewise,’
makes the stoutest heart dumb: truth and honesty shrink before it.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
If there are watch-words for the rabble, have not the polite and
fashionable their hackneyed phrases, their fulsome unmeaning jargon
as well? Both are to me anathema!</p>

<p class='c013'>To return to the first question, as it regards individual and private
manners. There is a fine illustration of the effects of preposterous
and affected gentility in the character of Gertrude, in the old comedy
of Eastward Hoe, written by Ben Jonson, Marston, and Chapman
in conjunction. This play is supposed to have given rise to Hogarth’s
series of prints of the Idle and Industrious Apprentice; and there is
something exceedingly Hogarthian in the view both of vulgar and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>genteel life here displayed. The character of Gertrude in particular,
the heroine of the piece, is inimitably drawn. The mixture of
vanity and meanness, the internal worthlessness, and external pretence,
the rustic ignorance and fine lady-like airs, the intoxication of
novelty and infatuation of pride, appear like a dream or romance,
rather than anything in real life. Cinderella and her glass-slipper
are common-place to it. She is not, like Millimant (a century afterwards)
the accomplished fine lady, but a pretender to all the foppery
and finery of the character. It is the honey-moon with her ladyship,
and her folly is at the full. To be a wife and the wife of a knight
are to her pleasures ‘worn in their newest gloss,’ and nothing can
exceed her raptures in the contemplation of both parts of the dilemma.
It is not familiarity but novelty, that weds her to the court. She
rises into the air of gentility from the ground of a city life, and
flutters about there with all the fantastic delight of a butterfly that has
just changed its caterpillar state. The sound of My Lady intoxicates
her with delight, makes her giddy, and almost turns her brain.
On the bare strength of it she is ready to turn her father and mother
out of doors, and treats her brother and sister with infinite disdain
and judicial hardness of heart. With some speculators the modern
philosophy has deadened and distorted all the natural affections: and
before abstract ideas and the mischievous refinements of literature
were introduced, nothing was to be met with in the primeval state of
society but simplicity and pastoral innocence of manners—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And all was conscience and tender heart.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This historical play gives the lie to the above theory pretty broadly,
yet delicately. Our heroine is as vain as she is ignorant, and as
unprincipled as she is both; and without an idea or wish of any kind
but that of adorning her person in the glass, and being called and
thought a lady, something superior to a citizen’s wife.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> She is so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>bent on finery that she believes in miracles to obtain it, and expects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the fairies to bring it her.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a> She is quite above thinking of a settlement,
jointure, or pin-money. She takes the will for the deed all
through the piece, and is so besotted with this ignorant, vulgar
notion of rank and title as a real thing that cannot be counterfeited,
that she is dupe of her own fine stratagems, and marries a gull, a
dolt, a broken adventurer for an accomplished and brave gentleman.
Her meanness is equal to her folly and her pride (and nothing can
be greater), yet she holds out on the strength of her original pretensions
for a long time, and plays the upstart with decent and
imposing consistency. Indeed her infatuation and caprices are akin
to the flighty perversity of a disordered imagination; and another
turn of the wheel of good or evil fortune would have sent her to
keep company with Hogarth’s <cite>Merveilleuses</cite> in Bedlam, or with
Deckar’s group of coquets in the same place. The other parts of
the play are a dreary lee-shore, like Cuckold’s Point on the coast of
Essex, where the preconcerted shipwreck takes place that winds up
the catastrophe of the piece. But this is also characteristic of the
age, and serves as a contrast to the airy and factitious character
which is the principal figure in the plot. We had made but little progress
from that point till Hogarth’s time, if Hogarth is to be
believed in his description of city manners. How wonderfully we
have distanced it since!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Without going into this at length, there is one circumstance I
would mention in which I think there has been a striking improvement
in the family economy of modern times—and that is in the
relation of mistresses and servants. After visits and finery, a married
woman of the old school had nothing to do but to attend to her
housewifery. She had no other resource, no other sense of power,
but to harangue and lord it over her domestics. Modern book-education
supplies the place of the old-fashioned system of kitchen
persecution and eloquence. A well-bred woman now seldom goes
into the kitchen to look after the servants:—formerly what was
called a good manager, an exemplary mistress of a family, did
nothing but hunt them from morning to night, from one year’s end
to another, without leaving them a moment’s rest, peace, or comfort.
Now a servant is left to do her work without this suspicious and
tormenting interference and fault-finding at every step, and she does
it all the better. The proverbs about the mistress’s eye, &amp;c. are no
longer held for current. A woman from this habit, which at last
became an unconquerable passion, would scold her maids for fifty
years together, and nothing could stop her: now the temptation to
read the last new poem or novel, and the necessity of talking of it
in the next company she goes into, prevent her—and the benefit to
all parties is incalculable!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XVII<br /> <span class='small'>ON A LANDSCAPE OF NICOLAS POUSSIN</span></h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And blind Orion hungry for the morn.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Orion, the subject of this landscape, was the classical Nimrod; and
is called by Homer, ‘a hunter of shadows, himself a shade.’ He
was the son of Neptune; and having lost an eye in some affray
between the Gods and men, was told that if he would go to meet
the rising sun, he would recover his sight. He is represented setting
out on his journey, with men on his shoulders to guide him, a bow in
his hand, and Diana in the clouds greeting him. He stalks along, a
giant upon earth, and reels and falters in his gait, as if just awaked
out of sleep, or uncertain of his way;—you see his blindness, though
his back is turned. Mists rise around him, and veil the sides of the
green forests; earth is dank and fresh with dews, the ‘grey dawn
and the Pleiades before him dance,’ and in the distance are seen the
blue hills and sullen ocean. Nothing was ever more finely conceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>or done. It breathes the spirit of the morning; its moisture, its
repose, its obscurity, waiting the miracle of light to kindle it into
smiles: the whole is, like the principal figure in it, ‘a forerunner of
the dawn.’ The same atmosphere tinges and imbues every object,
the same dull light ‘shadowy sets off’ the face of nature: one feeling
of vastness, of strangeness, and of primeval forms pervades the painter’s
canvas, and we are thrown back upon the first integrity of things.
This great and learned man might be said to see nature through the
glass of time: he alone has a right to be considered as the painter of
classical antiquity. Sir Joshua has done him justice in this respect.
He could give to the scenery of his heroic fables that unimpaired look
of original nature, full, solid, large, luxuriant, teeming with life and
power; or deck it with all the pomp of art, with temples and towers,
and mythologic groves. His pictures ‘denote a foregone conclusion.’
He applies nature to his purposes, works out her images according to
the standard of his thoughts, embodies high fictions; and the first
conception being given, all the rest seems to grow out of, and be
assimilated to it, by the unfailing process of a studious imagination.
Like his own Orion, he overlooks the surrounding scene, appears to
‘take up the isles as a very little thing, and to lay the earth in a
balance.’ With a laborious and mighty grasp, he put nature into the
mould of the ideal and antique; and was among painters (more than
any one else) what Milton was among poets. There is in both
something of the same pedantry, the same stiffness, the same elevation,
the same grandeur, the same mixture of art and nature, the same
richness of borrowed materials, the same unity of character. Neither
the poet nor the painter lowered the subjects they treated, but filled
up the outline in the fancy, and added strength and reality to it; and
thus not only satisfied, but surpassed the expectations of the spectator
and the reader. This is held for the triumph and the perfection of
works of art. To give us nature, such as we see it, is well and
deserving of praise; to give us nature, such as we have never seen,
but have often wished to see it, is better, and deserving of higher
praise. He who can show the world in its first naked glory, with
the hues of fancy spread over it, or in its high and palmy state, with
the gravity of history stamped on the proud monuments of vanished
empire,—who, by his ‘so potent art,’ can recal time past, transport
us to distant places, and join the regions of imagination (a new
conquest) to those of reality,—who shows us not only what nature
is, but what she has been, and is capable of,—he who does this,
and does it with simplicity, with truth, and grandeur, is lord of
nature and her powers; and his mind is universal, and his art the
master-art!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>There is nothing in this ‘more than natural,’ if criticism could be
persuaded to think so. The historic painter does not neglect or
contravene nature, but follows her more closely up into her fantastic
heights, or hidden recesses. He demonstrates what she would be in
conceivable circumstances, and under implied conditions. He ‘gives
to airy nothing a local habitation,’ not ‘a name.’ At his touch,
words start up into images, thoughts become things. He clothes a
dream, a phantom with form and colour and the wholesome attributes
of reality. <em>His</em> art is a second nature; not a different one. There
are those, indeed, who think that not to copy nature, is the rule for
attaining perfection. Because they cannot paint the objects which
they have seen, they fancy themselves qualified to paint the ideas which
they have not seen. But it is possible to fail in this latter and more
difficult style of imitation, as well as in the former humbler one.
The detection, it is true, is not so easy, because the objects are not
so nigh at hand to compare, and therefore there is more room both
for false pretension and for self-deceit. They take an epic motto or
subject, and conclude that the spirit is implied as a thing of course.
They paint inferior portraits, maudlin lifeless faces, without ordinary
expression, or one look, feature, or particle of nature in them, and
think that this is to rise to the truth of history. They vulgarise and
degrade whatever is interesting or sacred to the mind, and suppose
that they thus add to the dignity of their profession. They represent
a face that seems as if no thought or feeling of any kind had ever
passed through it, and would have you believe that this is the very
sublime of expression, such as it would appear in heroes, or demi-gods
of old, when rapture or agony was raised to its height. They show
you a landscape that looks as if the sun never shone upon it, and tell
you that it is not modern—that so earth looked when Titan first
kissed it with his rays. This is not the true <em>ideal</em>. It is not to fill
the moulds of the imagination, but to deface and injure them: it is
not to come up to, but to fall short of the poorest conception in the
public mind. Such pictures should not be hung in the same room
with that of Orion.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Poussin was, of all painters, the most poetical. He was the
painter of ideas. No one ever told a story half so well, nor so well
knew what was capable of being told by the pencil. He seized on,
and struck off with grace and precision, just that point of view which
would be likely to catch the reader’s fancy. There is a significance,
a consciousness in whatever he does (sometimes a vice, but oftener a
virtue) beyond any other painter. His Giants sitting on the tops of
craggy mountains, as huge themselves, and playing idly on their
Pan’s-pipes, seem to have been seated there these three thousand
years, and to know the beginning and the end of their own story.
An infant Bacchus or Jupiter is big with his future destiny. Even
inanimate and dumb things speak a language of their own. His
snakes, the messengers of fate, are inspired with human intellect.
His trees grow and expand their leaves in the air, glad of the rain,
proud of the sun, awake to the winds of heaven. In his Plague of
Athens, the very buildings seem stiff with horror. His picture of
the Deluge is, perhaps, the finest historical landscape in the world.
You see a waste of waters, wide, interminable: the sun is labouring,
wan and weary, up the sky; the clouds, dull and leaden, lie like a
load upon the eye, and heaven and earth seem commingling into one
confused mass! His human figures are sometimes ‘o’er-informed’
with this kind of feeling. Their actions have too much gesticulation,
and the set expression of the features borders too much on the
mechanical and caricatured style. In this respect, they form a
contrast to Raphael’s, whose figures never appear to be sitting for
their pictures, or to be conscious of a spectator, or to have come from
the painter’s hand. In Nicolas Poussin, on the contrary, every
thing seems to have a distinct understanding with the artist: ‘the
very stones prate of their whereabout:’ each object has its part and
place assigned, and is in a sort of compact with the rest of the
picture. It is this conscious keeping, and, as it were, <em>internal</em>
design, that gives their peculiar character to the works of this
artist. There was a picture of Aurora in the British Gallery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>a year or two ago. It was a suffusion of golden light. The
Goddess wore her saffron-coloured robes, and appeared just risen
from the gloomy bed of old Tithonus. Her very steeds, milk-white,
were tinged with the yellow dawn. It was a personification
of the morning.—Poussin succeeded better in classic than in
sacred subjects. The latter are comparatively heavy, forced, full of
violent contrasts of colour, of red, blue, and black, and without the
true prophetic inspiration of the characters. But in his Pagan allegories
and fables he was quite at home. The native gravity and native
levity of the Frenchman were combined with Italian scenery and an
antique gusto, and gave even to his colouring an air of learned indifference.
He wants, in one respect, grace, form, expression; but he
has every where sense and meaning, perfect costume and propriety.
His personages always belong to the class and time represented, and
are strictly versed in the business in hand. His grotesque compositions
in particular, his Nymphs and Fauns, are superior (at least, as
far as style is concerned) even to those of Rubens. They are taken
more immediately out of fabulous history. Rubens’s Satyrs and
Bacchantes have a more jovial and voluptuous aspect, are more drunk
with pleasure, more full of animal spirits and riotous impulses; they
laugh and bound along—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Leaping like wanton kids in pleasant spring:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>but those of Poussin have more of the intellectual part of the character,
and seem vicious on reflection, and of set purpose. Rubens’s
are noble specimens of a class; Poussin’s are allegorical abstractions
of the same class, with bodies less pampered, but with minds more
secretly depraved. The Bacchanalian groups of the Flemish painter
were, however, his masterpieces in composition. Witness those
prodigies of colour, character, and expression, at Blenheim. In the
more chaste and refined delineation of classic fable, Poussin was
without a rival. Rubens, who was a match for him in the wild and
picturesque, could not pretend to vie with the elegance and purity of
thought in his picture of Apollo giving a poet a cup of water to
drink, nor with the gracefulness of design in the figure of a nymph
squeezing the juice of a bunch of grapes from her fingers (a rosy
wine-press) which falls into the mouth of a chubby infant below.
But, above all, who shall celebrate, in terms of fit praise, his picture
of the shepherds in the Vale of Tempe going out in a fine morning
of the spring, and coming to a tomb with this inscription:—<span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et ego
in Arcadia vixi</span></span>! The eager curiosity of some, the expression of
others who start back with fear and surprise, the clear breeze playing
with the branches of the shadowing trees, ‘the valleys low, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the mild zephyrs use,’ the distant, uninterrupted, sunny prospect
speak (and for ever will speak on) of ages past to ages yet to
come!<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Pictures are a set of chosen images, a stream of pleasant thoughts
passing through the mind. It is a luxury to have the walls of our
rooms hung round with them, and no less so to have such a gallery
in the mind, to con over the relics of ancient art bound up ‘within
the book and volume of the brain, unmixed (if it were possible)
with baser matter!’ A life passed among pictures, in the study and
the love of art, is a happy noiseless dream: or rather, it is to dream
and to be awake at the same time; for it has all ‘the sober certainty
of waking bliss,’ with the romantic voluptuousness of a visionary and
abstracted being. They are the bright consummate essences of things,
and ‘he who knows of these delights to taste and interpose them oft,
is not unwise!’—The Orion, which I have here taken occasion to
descant upon, is one of a collection of excellent pictures, as this
collection is itself one of a series from the old masters, which have
for some years back embrowned the walls of the British Gallery,
and enriched the public eye. What hues (those of nature mellowed
by time) breathe around, as we enter! What forms are there, woven
into the memory! What looks, which only the answering looks of
the spectator can express! What intellectual stores have been yearly
poured forth from the shrine of ancient art! The works are various,
but the names the same—heaps of Rembrandts frowning from the
darkened walls, Rubens’s glad gorgeous groups, Titians more rich
and rare, Claudes always exquisite, sometimes beyond compare,
Guido’s endless cloying sweetness, the learning of Poussin and the
Caracci, and Raphael’s princely magnificence, crowning all. We
read certain letters and syllables in the catalogue, and at the well-known
magic sound, a miracle of skill and beauty starts to view.
One might think that one year’s prodigal display of such perfection
would exhaust the labours of one man’s life; but the next year, and
the next to that, we find another harvest reaped and gathered in to
the great garner of art, by the same immortal hands—</p>

Fame, and in the very names of the great heirs of glory ‘there were
propagation too!’ It is something to have a collection of this sort
to count upon once a year; to have one last, lingering look yet to
come. Pictures are scattered like stray gifts through the world;
and while they remain, earth has yet a little gilding left, not quite
rubbed off, dishonoured, and defaced. There are plenty of standard
works still to be found in this country, in the collections at Blenheim,
at Burleigh, and in those belonging to Mr. Angerstein, Lord
Grosvenor, the Marquis of Stafford, and others, to keep up this
treat to the lovers of art for many years: and it is the more desirable
to reserve a privileged sanctuary of this sort, where the eye may
dote, and the heart take its fill of such pictures as Poussin’s Orion,
since the Louvre is stripped of its triumphant spoils, and since he,
who collected it, and wore it as a rich jewel in his Iron Crown, the
hunter of greatness and of glory, is himself a shade!—</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XVIII<br /> <span class='small'>ON MILTON’S SONNETS</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>The great object of the Sonnet seems to be, to express in musical
numbers, and as it were with undivided breath, some occasional
thought or personal feeling, ‘some fee-grief due to the poet’s breast.’
It is a sigh uttered from the fulness of the heart, an involuntary
aspiration born and dying in the same moment. I have always been
fond of Milton’s Sonnets for this reason, that they have more of this
personal and internal character than any others; and they acquire a
double value when we consider that they come from the pen of the
loftiest of our poets. Compared with Paradise Lost, they are like
tender flowers that adorn the base of some proud column or stately
temple. The author in the one could work himself up with unabated
fortitude ‘to the height of his great argument;’ but in the other he
has shewn that he could condescend to men of low estate, and after
the lightning and the thunder-bolt of his pen, lets fall some drops of
‘natural pity’ over hapless infirmity, mingling strains with the nightingale’s,
‘most musical, most melancholy.’ The immortal poet pours
his mortal sorrows into our breasts, and a tear falls from his sightless
orbs on the friendly hand he presses. The Sonnets are a kind of
pensive record of past achievements, loves, and friendships, and a
noble exhortation to himself to bear up with cheerful hope and confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>to the last. Some of them are of a more quaint and humorous
character; but I speak of those only, which are intended to be serious
and pathetical.—I do not know indeed but they may be said to be
almost the first effusions of this sort of natural and personal sentiment
in the language. Drummond’s ought perhaps to be excepted, were
they formed less closely on the model of Petrarch’s, so as to be often
little more than translations of the Italian poet. But Milton’s Sonnets
are truly his own in allusion, thought, and versification. Those of
Sir Philip Sidney, who was a great transgressor in this way, turn
sufficiently on himself and his own adventures; but they are elaborately
quaint and intricate, and more like riddles than sonnets. They
are ‘very tolerable and not to be endured.’ Shakespear’s, which
some persons better-informed in such matters than I can pretend to
be, profess to cry up as ‘the divine, the matchless, what you will,’—to
say nothing of the want of point or a leading, prominent idea in
most of them, are I think overcharged and monotonous, and as to
their ultimate drift, as for myself, I can make neither head nor tail of
it. Yet some of them, I own, are sweet even to a sense of faintness,
luscious as the woodbine, and graceful and luxuriant like it. Here
is one.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘From you have I been absent in the spring,</div>
      <div class='line'>When proud-pied April, dress’d in all his trim,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing;</div>
      <div class='line'>That heavy Saturn laugh’d and leap’d with him.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell</div>
      <div class='line'>Of different flowers in odour and in hue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could make me any summer’s story tell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor did I wonder at the lilies white,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;</div>
      <div class='line'>They were but sweet, but figures of delight,</div>

      <div class='line'>Yet seem’d it winter still; and you away,</div>
      <div class='line'>As with your shadow, I with these did play.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I am not aware of any writer of Sonnets worth mentioning here
till long after Milton, that is, till the time of Warton and the revival
of a taste for Italian and for our own early literature. During the
rage for French models, the Sonnet had not been much studied. It
is a mode of composition that depends entirely on <em>expression</em>; and
this the French and artificial style gladly dispenses with, as it lays no
particular stress on any thing—except vague, general common-places.
Warton’s Sonnets are undoubtedly exquisite, both in style and matter:
they are poetical and philosophical effusions of very delightful sentiment;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>but the thoughts, though fine and deeply felt, are not, like
Milton’s subjects, identified completely with the writer, and so far
want a more individual interest. Mr. Wordsworth’s are also finely
conceived and high-sounding Sonnets. They mouth it well, and are
said to be sacred to Liberty. Brutus’s exclamation, ‘Oh Virtue, I
thought thee a substance, but I find thee a shadow,’ was not considered
as a compliment, but as a bitter sarcasm. The beauty of
Milton’s Sonnets is their sincerity, the spirit of poetical patriotism
which they breathe. Either Milton’s or the living bard’s are
defective in this respect. There is no Sonnet of Milton’s on the
Restoration of Charles <span class='fss'>II</span>. There is no Sonnet of Mr. Wordsworth’s,
corresponding to that of ‘the poet blind and bold,’ <cite>On the
late Massacre in Piedmont</cite>. It would be no niggard praise to Mr.
Wordsworth to grant that he was either half the man or half the
poet that Milton was. He has not his high and various imagination,
nor his deep and fixed principle. Milton did not worship the rising
sun, nor turn his back on a losing and fallen cause.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Such recantation had no charms for him!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Southey has thought proper to put the author of Paradise
Lost into his late Heaven, on the understood condition that he is ‘no
longer to kings and to hierarchs hostile.’ In his life-time, he gave no
sign of such an alteration; and it is rather presumptuous in the poet-laureate
to pursue the deceased antagonist of Salmasius into the other
world to compliment him with his own infirmity of purpose. It is a
wonder he did not add in a note that Milton called him aside to whisper
in his ear that he preferred the new English hexameters to his own
blank verse!</p>

<p class='c013'>Our first of poets was one of our first of men. He was an eminent
instance to prove that a poet is not another name for the slave of
power and fashion; as is the case with painters and musicians—things
without an opinion—and who merely aspire to make up the
pageant and shew of the day. There are persons in common life
who have that eager curiosity and restless admiration of bustle and
splendour, that sooner than not be admitted on great occasions of
feasting and luxurious display, they will go in the character of livery-servants
to stand behind the chairs of the great. There are others
who can so little bear to be left for any length of time out of the
grand carnival and masquerade of pride and folly, that they will gain
admittance to it at the expense of their characters as well as of a
change of dress. Milton was not one of these. He had too much
of the <em>ideal</em> faculty in his composition, a lofty contemplative principle,
and consciousness of inward power and worth, to be tempted by such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>idle baits. We have plenty of chaunting and chiming in among some
modern writers with the triumphs over their own views and principles;
but none of a patient resignation to defeat, sustaining and nourishing
itself with the thought of the justice of their cause, and with firm-fixed
rectitude. I do not pretend to defend the tone of Milton’s
political writings (which was borrowed from the style of controversial
divinity) or to say that he was right in the part he took:—I say that
he was consistent in it, and did not convict himself of error: he was
consistent in it in spite of danger and obloquy, ‘on evil days though
fallen, and evil tongues,’ and therefore his character has the salt of
honesty about it. It does not offend in the nostrils of posterity.
He had taken his part boldly and stood to it manfully, and submitted
to the change of times with pious fortitude, building his consolations
on the resources of his own mind and the recollection of the past,
instead of endeavouring to make himself a retreat for the time to
come. As an instance of this, we may take one of the best and most
admired of these Sonnets, that addressed to Cyriac Skinner, on his
own blindness.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Cyriac, this three years’ day, these eyes, though clear,</div>
      <div class='line'>To outward view, of blemish or of spot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bereft of light their seeing have forgot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear</div>
      <div class='line'>Of sun or moon or star throughout the year,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or man or woman. Yet I argue not</div>
      <div class='line'>Against Heav’n’s hand or will, nor bate a jot</div>
      <div class='line'>Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer</div>
      <div class='line'>Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask?</div>
      <div class='line'>The conscience, Friend, to have lost them overply’d</div>
      <div class='line'>In liberty’s defence, my noble task,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of which all Europe talks from side to side.</div>
      <div class='line'>This thought might lead me through the world’s vain mask,</div>
      <div class='line'>Content though blind, had I no better guide.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Nothing can exceed the mild, subdued tone of this Sonnet, nor the
striking grandeur of the concluding thought. It is curious to remark
what seems to be a trait of character in the two first lines. From
Milton’s care to inform the reader that ‘his eyes were still clear to
outward view of spot or blemish,’ it would be thought that he had
not yet given up all regard to personal appearance; a feeling to which
his singular beauty at an earlier age might be supposed naturally
enough to lead.—Of the political or (what may be called) his <cite>State-Sonnets</cite>,
those to Cromwell, to Fairfax, and to the younger Vane, are
full of exalted praise and dignified advice. They are neither familiar
nor servile. The writer knows what is due to power and to fame.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>He feels the true, unassumed equality of greatness. He pays the
full tribute of admiration for great acts atchieved, and suggests
becoming occasion to deserve higher praise. That to Cromwell is a
proof how completely our poet maintained the erectness of his understanding
and spirit in his intercourse with men in power. It is such
a compliment as a poet might pay to a conqueror and head of the
state, without the possibility of self-degradation.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud,</div>

<p class='c013'>In the Nineteenth Sonnet, which is also <cite>On his blindness</cite>, we see the

<p class='c013'>Those to Mr. Henry Lawes <cite>On his Airs</cite>, and to Mr. Lawrence,

lightness, with a certain melancholy complaining intermixed, might
be stolen from the harp of Æolus. The last is the picture of a day
spent in social retirement and elegant relaxation from severer studies.
We sit with the poet at table and hear his familiar sentiments from
his own lips afterwards.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the last, <cite>On his deceased Wife</cite>, the allusion to Alcestis is beautiful,
and shews how the poet’s mind raised and refined his thoughts by
exquisite classical conceptions, and how these again were enriched
by a passionate reference to actual feelings and images. It is this
rare union that gives such voluptuous dignity and touching purity to
Milton’s delineation of the female character.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Methought I saw my late espoused saint</div>
      <div class='line'>Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom Jove’s great son to her glad husband gave,</div>

      <div class='line'>Her face was veil’d, yet to my fancied sight</div>
      <div class='line'>Love, sweetness, goodness in her person shined</div>
      <div class='line'>So clear, as in no face with more delight:</div>
      <div class='line'>But O as to embrace me she inclined,</div>
      <div class='line'>I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There could not have been a greater mistake or a more unjust
piece of criticism than to suppose that Milton only shone on great
subjects; and that on ordinary occasions and in familiar life, his mind
was unwieldy, averse to the cultivation of grace and elegance, and
unsusceptible of harmless pleasures. The whole tenour of his smaller
compositions contradicts this opinion, which however they have been
cited to confirm. The notion first got abroad from the bitterness (or
vehemence) of his controversial writings, and has been kept up since
with little meaning and with less truth. His Letters to Donatus and
others are not more remarkable for the display of a scholastic enthusiasm,
than for that of the most amiable dispositions. They are
‘severe in youthful virtue unreproved.’ There is a passage in his
prose-works (the Treatise on Education) which shews, I think, his
extreme openness and proneness to pleasing outward impressions in a
striking point of view. ‘But to return to our own institute,’ he says,
‘besides these constant exercises at home, there is another opportunity
of gaining experience to be won from pleasure itself abroad. <em>In those
vernal seasons of the year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an
injury and sullenness against nature, not to go out and see her riches, and
partake in her rejoicing with Heaven and earth.</em> I should not therefore
be a persuader to them of studying much then, but to ride out in
companies with prudent and well staid guides, to all quarters of the
land,’ &amp;c. Many other passages might be quoted, in which the poet
breaks through the ground-work of prose, as it were, by natural
fecundity and a genial, unrestrained sense of delight. To suppose
that a poet is not easily accessible to pleasure, or that he does not
take an interest in individual objects and feelings, is to suppose that
he is no poet; and proceeds on the false theory, which has been so
often applied to poetry and the Fine Arts, that the whole is not made
up of the particulars. If our author, according to Dr. Johnson’s
account of him, could only have treated epic, high-sounding subjects,
he would not have been what he was, but another Sir Richard
Blackmore.—I may conclude with observing, that I have often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>wished that Milton had lived to see the Revolution of 1688. This
would have been a triumph worthy of him, and which he would have
earned by faith and hope. He would then have been old, but would
not have lived in vain to see it, and might have celebrated the event
in one more undying strain!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XIX<br /> <span class='small'>ON GOING A JOURNEY</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>One of the pleasantest things in the world is going a journey; but I

<p class='c013'>I cannot see the wit of walking and talking at the same time.
When I am in the country, I wish to vegetate like the country. I
am not for criticising hedge-rows and black cattle. I go out of town
in order to forget the town and all that is in it. There are those
who for this purpose go to watering-places, and carry the metropolis
with them. I like more elbow-room, and fewer incumbrances. I

<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>impertinence. Give me the clear blue sky over my head, and the
green turf beneath my feet, a winding road before me, and a three
hours’ march to dinner—and then to thinking! It is hard if I
cannot start some game on these lone heaths. I laugh, I run, I leap,
I sing for joy. From the point of yonder rolling cloud, I plunge
into my past being, and revel there, as the sun-burnt Indian plunges
headlong into the wave that wafts him to his native shore. Then
long-forgotten things, like ‘sunken wrack and sumless treasuries,’
burst upon my eager sight, and I begin to feel, think, and be myself
again. Instead of an awkward silence, broken by attempts at wit or
dull common-places, mine is that undisturbed silence of the heart
which alone is perfect eloquence. No one likes puns, alliterations,
antitheses, argument, and analysis better than I do; but I sometimes
had rather be without them. ‘Leave, oh, leave me to my repose!’
I have just now other business in hand, which would seem idle to
you, but is with me ‘very stuff of the conscience.’ Is not this wild
rose sweet without a comment? Does not this daisy leap to my heart
set in its coat of emerald? Yet if I were to explain to you the
circumstance that has so endeared it to me, you would only smile.
Had I not better then keep it to myself, and let it serve me to brood
over, from here to yonder craggy point, and from thence onward to
the far-distant horizon? I should be but bad company all that way,
and therefore prefer being alone. I have heard it said that you may,
when the moody fit comes on, walk or ride on by yourself, and
indulge your reveries. But this looks like a breach of manners, a
neglect of others, and you are thinking all the time that you ought to
rejoin your party. ‘Out upon such half-faced fellowship,’ say I. I
like to be either entirely to myself, or entirely at the disposal of
others; to talk or be silent, to walk or sit still, to be sociable or
solitary. I was pleased with an observation of Mr. Cobbett’s, that
‘he thought it a bad French custom to drink our wine with our
meals, and that an Englishman ought to do only one thing at a time.’
So I cannot talk and think, or indulge in melancholy musing and
lively conversation by fits and starts. ‘Let me have a companion of
my way,’ says Sterne, ‘were it but to remark how the shadows
lengthen as the sun declines.’ It is beautifully said: but in my
opinion, this continual comparing of notes interferes with the
involuntary impression of things upon the mind, and hurts the
sentiment. If you only hint what you feel in a kind of dumb show,
it is insipid: if you have to explain it, it is making a toil of a
pleasure. You cannot read the book of nature, without being
perpetually put to the trouble of translating it for the benefit of
others. I am for the synthetical method on a journey, in preference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>to the analytical. I am content to lay in a stock of ideas then, and
to examine and anatomise them afterwards. I want to see my vague
notions float like the down of the thistle before the breeze, and not
to have them entangled in the briars and thorns of controversy. For
once, I like to have it all my own way; and this is impossible unless
you are alone, or in such company as I do not covet. I have no
objection to argue a point with any one for twenty miles of measured
road, but not for pleasure. If you remark the scent of a beanfield
crossing the road, perhaps your fellow-traveller has no smell. If you
point to a distant object, perhaps he is short-sighted, and has to take
out his glass to look at it. There is a feeling in the air, a tone in
the colour of a cloud which hits your fancy, but the effect of which
you are unable to account for. There is then no sympathy, but an
uneasy craving after it, and a dissatisfaction which pursues you on the
way, and in the end probably produces ill humour. Now I never
quarrel with myself, and take all my own conclusions for granted till
I find it necessary to defend them against objections. It is not
merely that you may not be of accord on the objects and circumstances
that present themselves before you—these may recal a number
of objects, and lead to associations too delicate and refined to be
possibly communicated to others. Yet these I love to cherish, and
sometimes still fondly clutch them, when I can escape from the
throng to do so. To give way to our feelings before company,
seems extravagance or affectation; and on the other hand, to have to
unravel this mystery of our being at every turn, and to make others
take an equal interest in it (otherwise the end is not answered) is a
task to which few are competent. We must ‘give it an understanding,
but no tongue.’ My old friend C—, however, could do
both. He could go on in the most delightful explanatory way over
hill and dale, a summer’s day, and convert a landscape into a didactic
poem or a Pindaric ode. ‘He talked far above singing.’ If I
could so clothe my ideas in sounding and flowing words, I might
perhaps wish to have some one with me to admire the swelling
theme; or I could be more content, were it possible for me still to
hear his echoing voice in the woods of All-Foxden. They had
‘that fine madness in them which our first poets had;’ and if they
could have been caught by some rare instrument, would have breathed
such strains as the following.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Had I words and images at command like these, I would attempt to
wake the thoughts that lie slumbering on golden ridges in the evening
clouds: but at the sight of nature my fancy, poor as it is, droops and
closes up its leaves, like flowers at sunset. I can make nothing out
on the spot:—I must have time to collect myself.—</p>

<p class='c013'>In general, a good thing spoils out-of-door prospects: it should be
reserved for Table-talk. L— is for this reason, I take it, the
worst company in the world out of doors; because he is the best
within. I grant, there is one subject on which it is pleasant to talk
on a journey; and that is, what one shall have for supper when we
get to our inn at night. The open air improves this sort of conversation
or friendly altercation, by setting a keener edge on appetite.
Every mile of the road heightens the flavour of the viands we expect
at the end of it. How fine it is to enter some old town, walled and
turreted just at the approach of night-fall, or to come to some
straggling village, with the lights streaming through the surrounding
gloom; and then after inquiring for the best entertainment that the
place affords, to ‘take one’s ease at one’s inn!’ These eventful
moments in our lives’ history are too precious, too full of solid, heartfelt
happiness to be frittered and dribbled away in imperfect sympathy.
I would have them all to myself, and drain them to the last drop:
they will do to talk of or to write about afterwards. What a delicate
speculation it is, after drinking whole goblets of tea,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The cups that cheer, but not inebriate,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and letting the fumes ascend into the brain, to sit considering what we
shall have for supper—eggs and a rasher, a rabbit smothered in onions,
or an excellent veal-cutlet! Sancho in such a situation once fixed
upon cow-heel; and his choice, though he could not help it, is not
to be disparaged. Then in the intervals of pictured scenery and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Shandean contemplation, to catch the preparation and the stir in the
kitchen—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Procul, O procul este profani!</span></i> These hours are sacred to
silence and to musing, to be treasured up in the memory, and to feed
the source of smiling thoughts hereafter. I would not waste them in
idle talk; or if I must have the integrity of fancy broken in upon,
I would rather it were by a stranger than a friend. A stranger takes
his hue and character from the time and place; he is a part of the
furniture and costume of an inn. If he is a Quaker, or from the
West Riding of Yorkshire, so much the better. I do not even try
to sympathise with him, and he breaks no squares. I associate
nothing with my travelling companion but present objects and passing
events. In his ignorance of me and my affairs, I in a manner forget
myself. But a friend reminds one of other things, rips up old
grievances, and destroys the abstraction of the scene. He comes
in ungraciously between us and our imaginary character. Something
is dropped in the course of conversation that gives a hint of your
profession and pursuits; or from having some one with you that
knows the less sublime portions of your history, it seems that other
people do. You are no longer a citizen of the world: but your
‘unhoused free condition is put into circumscription and confine.’
The <em>incognito</em> of an inn is one of its striking privileges—‘lord of
one’s-self, uncumber’d with a name.’ Oh! it is great to shake off
the trammels of the world and of public opinion—to lose our importunate,
tormenting, everlasting personal identity in the elements of
nature, and become the creature of the moment, clear of all ties—to
hold to the universe only by a dish of sweet-breads, and to owe
nothing but the score of the evening—and no longer seeking for
applause and meeting with contempt, to be known by no other title
than <em>the Gentleman in the parlour</em>! One may take one’s choice of all
characters in this romantic state of uncertainty as to one’s real pretensions,
and become indefinitely respectable and negatively rightworshipful.
We baffle prejudice and disappoint conjecture; and
from being so to others, begin to be objects of curiosity and wonder
even to ourselves. We are no more those hackneyed common-places
that we appear in the world: an inn restores us to the level
of nature, and quits scores with society! I have certainly spent
some enviable hours at inns—sometimes when I have been left
entirely to myself, and have tried to solve some metaphysical
problem, as once at Witham-common, where I found out the proof
that likeness is not a case of the association of ideas—at other times,
when there have been pictures in the room, as at St. Neot’s, (I
think it was) where I first met with Gribelin’s engravings of the
Cartoons, into which I entered at once, and at a little inn on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>borders of Wales, where there happened to be hanging some of
Westall’s drawings, which I compared triumphantly (for a theory
that I had, not for the admired artist) with the figure of a girl who
had ferried me over the Severn, standing up in the boat between me
and the twilight—at other times I might mention luxuriating in
books, with a peculiar interest in this way, as I remember sitting
up half the night to read Paul and Virginia, which I picked up at
an inn at Bridgewater, after being drenched in the rain all day; and
at the same place I got through two volumes of Madame D’Arblay’s
Camilla. It was on the tenth of April, 1798, that I sat down to a
volume of the New Eloise, at the inn at Llangollen, over a bottle of
sherry and a cold chicken. The letter I chose was that in which
St. Preux describes his feelings as he first caught a glimpse from the
heights of the Jura of the Pays de Vaud, which I had brought with
me as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon bouche</span></i> to crown the evening with. It was my birthday,
and I had for the first time come from a place in the neighbourhood
to visit this delightful spot. The road to Llangollen turns off between
Chirk and Wrexham; and on passing a certain point, you come all
at once upon the valley, which opens like an amphitheatre, broad,
barren hills rising in majestic state on either side, with ‘green upland
swells that echo to the bleat of flocks’ below, and the river Dee
babbling over its stony bed in the midst of them. The valley at
this time ‘glittered green with sunny showers,’ and a budding ash-tree
dipped its tender branches in the chiding stream. How proud, how
glad I was to walk along the high road that overlooks the delicious
prospect, repeating the lines which I have just quoted from Mr.
Coleridge’s poems! But besides the prospect which opened beneath
my feet, another also opened to my inward sight, a heavenly vision,
on which were written, in letters large as Hope could make them,
these four words, <span class='sc'>Liberty</span>, <span class='sc'>Genius</span>, <span class='sc'>Love</span>, <span class='sc'>Virtue</span>; which have
since faded into the light of common day, or mock my idle gaze.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The beautiful is vanished, and returns not.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Still I would return some time or other to this enchanted spot; but
I would return to it alone. What other self could I find to share
that influx of thoughts, of regret, and delight, the fragments of which
I could hardly conjure up to myself, so much have they been broken
and defaced! I could stand on some tall rock, and overlook the
precipice of years that separates me from what I then was. I was
at that time going shortly to visit the poet whom I have above named.
Where is he now? Not only I myself have changed; the world,
which was then new to me, has become old and incorrigible. Yet
will I turn to thee in thought, O sylvan Dee, in joy, in youth and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>gladness as thou then wert; and thou shalt always be to me the
river of Paradise, where I will drink of the waters of life freely!</p>

<p class='c013'>There is hardly any thing that shows the short-sightedness or
capriciousness of the imagination more than travelling does. With
change of place we change our ideas; nay, our opinions and feelings.
We can by an effort indeed transport ourselves to old and long-forgotten
scenes, and then the picture of the mind revives again;
but we forget those that we have just left. It seems that we can
think but of one place at a time. The canvas of the fancy is but of
a certain extent, and if we paint one set of objects upon it, they
immediately efface every other. We cannot enlarge our conceptions,
we only shift our point of view. The landscape bares its bosom to
the enraptured eye, we take our fill of it, and seem as if we could
form no other image of beauty or grandeur. We pass on, and think
no more of it: the horizon that shuts it from our sight, also blots
it from our memory like a dream. In travelling through a wild
barren country, I can form no idea of a woody and cultivated one.
It appears to me that all the world must be barren, like what I see of
it. In the country we forget the town, and in town we despise the
country. ‘Beyond Hyde Park,’ says Sir Fopling Flutter, ‘all is a
desert.’ All that part of the map that we do not see before us is
a blank. The world in our conceit of it is not much bigger than
a nutshell. It is not one prospect expanded into another, county
joined to county, kingdom to kingdom, lands to seas, making an
image voluminous and vast;—the mind can form no larger idea of
space than the eye can take in at a single glance. The rest is a
name written in a map, a calculation of arithmetic. For instance,
what is the true signification of that immense mass of territory and
population, known by the name of China to us? An inch of
paste-board on a wooden globe, of no more account than a China
orange! Things near us are seen of the size of life: things at a
distance are diminished to the size of the understanding. We measure
the universe by ourselves, and even comprehend the texture of our
own being only piece-meal. In this way, however, we remember an
infinity of things and places. The mind is like a mechanical instrument
that plays a great variety of tunes, but it must play them in
succession. One idea recalls another, but it at the same time excludes
all others. In trying to renew old recollections, we cannot as it were
unfold the whole web of our existence; we must pick out the single
threads. So in coming to a place where we have formerly lived and
with which we have intimate associations, every one must have found
that the feeling grows more vivid the nearer we approach the spot,
from the mere anticipation of the actual impression: we remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>circumstances, feelings, persons, faces, names, that we had not thought
of for years; but for the time all the rest of the world is forgotten!—To
return to the question I have quitted above.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have no objection to go to see ruins, aqueducts, pictures, in company
with a friend or a party, but rather the contrary, for the former
reason reversed. They are intelligible matters, and will bear talking
about. The sentiment here is not tacit, but communicable and overt.
Salisbury Plain is barren of criticism, but Stonehenge will bear a discussion
antiquarian, picturesque, and philosophical. In setting out on
a party of pleasure, the first consideration always is where we shall
go to: in taking a solitary ramble, the question is what we shall meet
with by the way. ‘The mind is its own place;’ nor are we anxious
to arrive at the end of our journey. I can myself do the honours
indifferently well to works of art and curiosity. I once took a party
to Oxford with no mean <em>eclat</em>—shewed them that seat of the Muses
at a distance,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘With glistering spires and pinnacles adorn’d’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>descanted on the learned air that breathes from the grassy quadrangles
and stone walls of halls and colleges—was at home in the Bodleian;
and at Blenheim quite superseded the powdered Ciceroni that attended
us, and that pointed in vain with his wand to common-place beauties
in matchless pictures.—As another exception to the above reasoning,
I should not feel confident in venturing on a journey in a foreign
country without a companion. I should want at intervals to hear
the sound of my own language. There is an involuntary antipathy
in the mind of an Englishman to foreign manners and notions that
requires the assistance of social sympathy to carry it off. As the
distance from home increases, this relief, which was at first a luxury,
becomes a passion and an appetite. A person would almost feel
stifled to find himself in the deserts of Arabia without friends and
countrymen: there must be allowed to be something in the view of
Athens or old Rome that claims the utterance of speech; and I own
that the Pyramids are too mighty for any single contemplation. In
such situations, so opposite to all one’s ordinary train of ideas, one
seems a species by one’s-self, a limb torn off from society, unless one
can meet with instant fellowship and support.—Yet I did not feel
this want or craving very pressing once, when I first set my foot on
the laughing shores of France. Calais was peopled with novelty and
delight. The confused, busy murmur of the place was like oil and
wine poured into my ears; nor did the mariners’ hymn, which was
sung from the top of an old crazy vessel in the harbour, as the sun
went down, send an alien sound into my soul. I only breathed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>air of general humanity. I walked over ‘the vine-covered hills and
gay regions of France,’ erect and satisfied; for the image of man was
not cast down and chained to the foot of arbitrary thrones: I was at
no loss for language, for that of all the great schools of painting was
open to me. The whole is vanished like a shade. Pictures, heroes,
glory, freedom, all are fled: nothing remains but the Bourbons and
the French people!—There is undoubtedly a sensation in travelling
into foreign parts that is to be had nowhere else: but it is more
pleasing at the time than lasting. It is too remote from our habitual
associations to be a common topic of discourse or reference, and, like
a dream or another state of existence, does not piece into our daily
modes of life. It is an animated but a momentary hallucination. It
demands an effort to exchange our actual for our ideal identity; and
to feel the pulse of our old transports revive very keenly, we must
‘jump’ all our present comforts and connexions. Our romantic and
itinerant character is not to be domesticated. Dr. Johnson remarked
how little foreign travel added to the facilities of conversation in those
who had been abroad. In fact, the time we have spent there is both
delightful and in one sense instructive; but it appears to be cut out
of our substantial, downright existence, and never to join kindly on
to it. We are not the same, but another, and perhaps more enviable
individual, all the time we are out of our own country. We are lost
to ourselves, as well as our friends. So the poet somewhat quaintly
sings,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Out of my country and myself I go.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Those who wish to forget painful thoughts, do well to absent themselves
for a while from the ties and objects that recal them: but we
can be said only to fulfil our destiny in the place that gave us birth.
I should on this account like well enough to spend the whole of my
life in travelling abroad, if I could any where borrow another life to
spend afterwards at home!—</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XX<br /> <span class='small'>ON COFFEE-HOUSE POLITICIANS</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>There is a set of people who fairly come under this denomination.
They spend their time and their breath in coffee-houses and other
places of public resort, hearing or repeating some new thing. They
sit with a paper in their hands in the morning, and with a pipe in
their mouths in the evening, discussing the contents of it. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Times, the Morning Chronicle, and the Herald are necessary to
their existence: in them ‘they live and move and have their being.’
The Evening Paper is impatiently expected, and called for at a
certain critical minute: the news of the morning become stale and
vapid by the dinner-hour. A fresher interest is required, an appetite
for the latest-stirring information is excited with the return of their
meals; and a glass of old port or humming ale hardly relishes as it
ought without the infusion of some lively topic that had its birth with
the day, and perishes before night. ‘Then come in the sweets of the
evening:’—the Queen, the coronation, the last new play, the next
fight, the insurrection of the Greeks or Neapolitans, the price of
stocks, or death of kings, keep them on the alert till bed-time. No
question comes amiss to them that is quite new—none is ever heard
of that is at all old.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The World before the Flood or the Intermediate State of the Soul
are never once thought of—such is the quick succession of subjects,
the suddenness and fugitiveness of the interest taken in them, that the
Two-penny Post-Bag would be at present looked upon as an old-fashioned
publication, and the Battle of Waterloo, like the proverb,
is somewhat musty. It is strange that people should take so much
interest at one time in what they so soon forget:—the truth is, they
feel no interest in it at any time, but it does for something to talk
about. Their ideas are served up to them, like their bill of fare, for
the day; and the whole creation, history, war, politics, morals,
poetry, metaphysics, is to them like a file of antedated newspapers, of
no use, not even for reference, except the one which lies on the
table!—You cannot take any of these persons at a greater disadvantage
than before they are provided with their cue for the day.
They ask with a face of dreary vacuity, ‘Have you any thing new?’—and
on receiving an answer in the negative, have nothing farther to
say. Talk of the Westminster Election, the Bridge-street Association,
or Mr. Cobbett’s Letter to John Cropper of Liverpool, and they are
alive again. Beyond the last twenty-four hours, or the narrow round
in which they move, they are utterly to seek, without ideas, feelings,
interests, apprehensions of any sort; so that if you betray any
knowledge beyond the vulgar routine of <span class='sc'>Second Editions</span> and firsthand
private intelligence, you pass with them for a dull fellow, not
acquainted with what is going forward in the world or with the
practical value of things. I have known a person of this stamp
censure John Cam Hobhouse for referring so often as he does to the
affairs of the Greeks and Romans, as if the affairs of the nation were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>not sufficient for his hands: another asks you if a General in modern
times cannot throw a bridge over a river without having studied
Cæsar’s Commentaries; and a third cannot see the use of the learned
languages, as he has observed that the greatest proficients in them are
rather taciturn than otherwise, and hesitate in their speech more than
other people. A dearth of general information is almost necessary
to the thorough-paced coffee-house politician; in the absence of
thought, imagination, sentiment, he is attracted immediately to the
nearest common-place, and floats through the chosen regions of noise
and empty rumours without difficulty and without distraction. Meet
‘any six of these men in buckram,’ and they will accost you with the
same question and the same answer: they have seen it somewhere in
print, or had it from some city-oracle, that morning; and the sooner
they vent their opinions the better, for they will not keep. Like
tickets of admission to the theatre for a particular evening, they must
be used immediately, or they will be worth nothing: and the object
is to find auditors for the one and customers for the other, neither of
which is difficult; since people who have no ideas of their own are
glad to hear what any one else has to say, as those who have not free
admissions to the play will very obligingly take up with an occasional
order.—It sometimes gives one a melancholy but mixed sensation to
see one of the better sort of this class of politicians, not without
talents or learning, absorbed for fifty years together in the all-engrossing
topic of the day: mounting on it for exercise and recreation of his
faculties, like the great horse at a riding-school, and after his short,
improgressive, untired career dismounting just where he got up;
flying abroad in continual consternation on the wings of all the
newspapers; waving his arm like a pump-handle in sign of constant
change, and spouting out torrents of puddled politics from his mouth;
dead to all interests but those of the state; seemingly neither older
nor wiser for age; unaccountably enthusiastic, stupidly romantic, and
actuated by no other motive than the mechanical operations of the
spirit of newsmongering!<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

that period seem not only to be older by two hundred years, and
proportionably wiser and wittier than we, but hardly a trace of them
is left, not even the memory of what has been. How should I make
my friend M— stare, if I were to mention the name of my still
better friend, old honest Signor Friscobaldo, the father of Bellafront:—yet
his name was perhaps invented, and the scenes in which he
figures unrivalled might for the first time have been read aloud to
thrilling ears on this very spot! Who reads Deckar now? Or if
by chance any one awakes the strings of that ancient lyre, and starts
with delight as they yield wild, broken music, is he not accused of
envy to the living Muse? What would a linen-draper from Holborn
think, if I were to ask him after the clerk of St. Andrew’s, the
immortal, the forgotten Webster? His name and his works are no
more heard of: though <em>these</em> were written with a pen of adamant,
‘within the red-leaved tables of the heart,’ his fame was ‘writ in
water.’ So perishable is genius, so swift is time, so fluctuating is
knowledge, and so far is it from being true that men perpetually
accumulate the means of improvement and refinement. On the
contrary, living knowledge is the tomb of the dead, and while light
and worthless materials float on the surface, the solid and sterling as
often sink to the bottom, and are swallowed up for ever in weeds and
quicksands!—A striking instance of the short-lived nature of popular
reputation occurred one evening at the S—, when we got into a
dispute, the most learned and recondite that ever took place, on the
comparative merits of Lord Byron and Gray. A country-gentleman
happened to drop in, and thinking to show off in London company,
launched into a lofty panegyric on the Bard of Gray as the sublimest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>composition in the English language. This assertion presently
appeared to be an anachronism, though it was probably the opinion in
vogue thirty years ago, when the gentleman was last in town. After
a little floundering, one of the party volunteered to express a more
contemporary sentiment, by asking in a tone of mingled confidence
and doubt—‘But you don’t think, Sir, that Gray is to be mentioned
as a poet in the same day with my Lord Byron?’ The disputants
were now at issue: all that resulted was that Gray was set aside as a
poet who would not go down among readers of the present day, and
his patron treated the works of the Noble Bard as mere ephemeral
effusions, and spoke of poets that would be admired thirty years
hence, which was the farthest stretch of his critical imagination.
His antagonist’s did not even reach so far. This was the most
romantic digression we ever had; and the subject was not afterwards
resumed.—No one here (generally speaking) has the slightest
notion of any thing that has happened, that has been said, thought,
or done out of his own recollection. It would be in vain
to hearken after those ‘wit-skirmishes,’ those ‘brave sublunary
things,’ which were the employment and delight of the Beaumonts
and Bens of former times: but we may happily repose on dulness,
drift with the tide of nonsense, and gain an agreeable vertigo by lending
an ear to endless controversies. The confusion, provided you do not
mingle in the fray and try to disentangle it, is amusing and edifying
enough. Every species of false wit and spurious argument may be
learnt here by potent examples. Whatever observations you hear
dropt, have been picked up in the same place or in a kindred atmosphere.
There is a kind of conversation made up entirely of scraps
and hearsay, as there are a kind of books made up entirely of
references to other books. This may account for the frequent contradictions
which abound in the discourse of persons educated and
disciplined wholly in coffee-houses. There is nothing stable or
well-grounded in it: it is ‘nothing but vanity, chaotic vanity.’ They
hear a remark at the Globe which they do not know what to make
of; another at the Rainbow in direct opposition to it; and not
having time to reconcile them, vent both at the Mitre. In the course
of half an hour, if they are not more than ordinarily dull, you are
sure to find them on opposite sides of the question. This is the
sickening part of it. People do not seem to talk for the sake of
expressing their opinions, but to maintain an opinion for the sake of
talking. We meet neither with modest ignorance nor studious
acquirement. Their knowledge has been taken in too much by
snatches to digest properly. There is neither sincerity nor system
in what they say. They hazard the first crude notion that comes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>hand, and then defend it how they can; which is for the most part
but ill. ‘Don’t you think,’ says M—, ‘that Mr. — is a very
sensible, well-informed man?’—‘Why no,’ I say, ‘he seems to me
to have no ideas of his own, and only to wait to see what others will
say in order to set himself against it. I should not think that is the
way to get at the truth. I do not desire to be driven out of my
conclusions (such as they are) merely to make way for his upstart
pretensions.’—‘Then there is —: what of him?’—‘He might
very well express all he has to say in half the time, and with half
the trouble. Why should he beat about the bush as he does? He
appears to be getting up a little speech, and practising on a smaller
scale for a Debating Society—the lowest ambition a man can have.
Besides, by his manner of drawling out his words, and interlarding
his periods with inuendos and formal reservations, he is evidently
making up his mind all the time which side he shall take. He puts
his sentences together as printers set up types, letter by letter.
There is certainly no principle of short-hand in his mode of elocution.
He goes round for a meaning, and the sense waits for him. It is
not conversation, but rehearsing a part. Men of education and men
of the world order this matter better. They know what they have
to say on a subject, and come to the point at once. Your coffee-house
politician balances between what he heard last and what he
shall say next; and not seeing his way clearly, puts you off with
circumstantial phrases, and tries to gain time for fear of making a
false step. This gentleman has heard some one admired for precision
and copiousness of language; and goes away, congratulating himself
that he has not made a blunder in grammar or in rhetoric the whole
evening. He is a theoretical <em>Quidnunc</em>—is tenacious in argument,
though wary; carries his point thus and thus, bandies objections and
answers with uneasy pleasantry, and when he has the worst of the
dispute, puns very emphatically on his adversary’s name, if it admits
of that kind of misconstruction.’ G— is admired by the waiter,
who is a sleek hand<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a> for his temper in managing an argument. Any
one else would perceive that the latent cause is not patience with his
antagonist, but satisfaction with himself. I think this unmoved self-complacency,
this cavalier smooth simpering indifference is more
annoying than the extremest violence or irritability. The one shews
that your opponent does care something about you, and may be put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>out of his way by your remarks; the other seems to announce that
nothing you say can shake his opinion a jot, that he has considered
the whole of what you have to offer beforehand, and that he is in all
respects much wiser and more accomplished than you. Such persons
talk to grown people with the same air of patronage and condescension
that they do to children. ‘They will explain’—is a
familiar expression with them, thinking you can only differ
from them in consequence of misconceiving what they say. Or
if you detect them in any error in point of fact (as to acknowledged
deficiency in wit or argument, they would smile at the
idea) they add some correction to your correction, and thus have
the whip-hand of you again, being more correct than you who
corrected them. If you hint some obvious oversight, they know
what you are going to say, and were aware of the objection before
you uttered it:—‘So shall their anticipation prevent your discovery.’
By being in the right you gain no advantage: by being in the wrong
you are entitled to the benefit of their pity or scorn! It is sometimes
curious to see a select group of our little Gotham getting about
a knotty point that will bear a wager, as whether Dr. Johnson’s
Dictionary was originally published in quarto or folio. The confident
assertions, the cautious overtures, the length of time demanded
to ascertain the fact, the precise terms of the forfeit, the provisos for
getting out of paying it at last, lead to a long and inextricable discussion.
G— was however so convinced in his own mind that
the Mourning Bride was written by Shakespear, that he ran headlong
into the snare: the bet was decided, and the punch was drank. He
has skill in numbers, and seldom exceeds his sevenpence.—He had a
brother once, no Michael Cassio, no great arithmetician: R—
was a rare fellow, of the driest humour, and the nicest tact, of
infinite sleights and evasions, of a picked phraseology, and the very
soul of mimicry. I fancy I have some insight into physiognomy
myself, but he could often expound to me at a single glance the
characters of those of my acquaintance that I had been most at fault
about. The account as it was cast up and balanced between us was
not always very favourable. How finely, how truly, how gaily he
took off the company at the S—! Poor and faint are my sketches
compared to his! It was like looking into a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">camera obscura</span></i>—you
saw faces shining and speaking—the smoke curled, the lights
dazzled, the oak wainscoting took a higher polish—there was old
S—, tall and gaunt, with his couplet from Pope and case at Nisi
Prius, M— eyeing the ventilator and lying <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdu</span></i> for a moral, and
H— and A— taking another friendly finishing glass!—These
and many more windfalls of character he gave us in thought, word,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and action. I remember his once describing three different persons
together to myself and M— B—, viz. the manager of a country
theatre, a tragic and a comic performer, till we were ready to tumble
on the floor with laughing at the oddity of their humours, and at
R—’s extraordinary powers of ventriloquism, bodily and mental;
and B— said (such was the vividness of the scene) that when he
awoke the next morning, he wondered what three amusing characters
he had been in company with the evening before. Oh! it was a
rich treat to see him describe M—df—rd, him of the Courier, the
Contemplative Man, who wrote an answer to Cœlebs, coming into a
room, folding up his great coat, taking out a little pocket volume,
laying it down to think, rubbing the calf of his leg with grave self-complacency,
and starting out of his reverie when spoken to with an
inimitable vapid exclamation of ‘Eh!’ M—df—rd is like a man
made of fleecy hosiery: R— was lank and lean ‘as is the ribbed
sea-sand.’ Yet he seemed the very man he represented, as fat, pert,
and dull as it was possible to be. I have not seen him of late:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘For Kais is fled, and our tents are forlorn.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>But I thought of him the other day when the news of the death of
Buonaparte came, whom we both loved for precisely contrary reasons,
he for putting down the rabble of the people, and I because he had
put down the rabble of kings. Perhaps this event may rouse him
from his lurking-place, where he lies like Reynard, with head
declined, in feigned slumbers!<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>I had almost forgotten the S— Tavern. We for some time
took C— for a lawyer, from a certain arguteness of voice and
slenderness of neck, and from his having a quibble and a laugh at
himself always ready. On inquiry, however, he was found to be
a patent-medicine seller, and having leisure in his apprenticeship,
and a forwardness of parts, he had taken to study Blackstone and
the Statutes at Large. On appealing to M— for his opinion
on this matter, he observed pithily, ‘I don’t like so much law:
the gentlemen here seem fond of law, but I have law enough at
chambers.’ One sees a great deal of the humours and tempers of
men in a place of this sort, and may almost gather their opinions
from their characters. There is E—, a fellow that is always in
the wrong—who puts might for right on all occasions—a Tory
in grain—who has no one idea but what has been instilled into him
by custom and authority—an everlasting babbler on the stronger side
of the question—querulous and dictatorial, and with a peevish whine
in his voice like a beaten school-boy. He is a great advocate for
the Bourbons, and for the National Debt. The former he affirms
to be the choice of the French people, and the latter he insists is
necessary to the salvation of these kingdoms. This last point a
little inoffensive gentleman among us, of a saturnine aspect but
simple conceptions, cannot comprehend. ‘I will tell you, Sir—I
will make my proposition so clear that you will be convinced of
the truth of my observation in a moment. Consider, Sir, the
number of trades that would be thrown out of employ, if it were
done away with: what would become of the porcelain manufacture
without it?’ Any stranger to overhear one of these debates would
swear that the English as a nation are bad logicians. Mood and
figure are unknown to them. They do not argue by the book.
They arrive at conclusions through the force of prejudice, and on
the principles of contradiction. Mr. E— having thus triumphed
in argument, offers a flower to the notice of the company as a
specimen of his flower-garden, a curious exotic, nothing like it to
be found in this kingdom, talks of his carnations, of his countryhouse,
and old English hospitality, but never invites any of his
friends to come down and take their Sunday’s dinner with him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>He is mean and ostentatious at the same time, insolent and servile,
does not know whether to treat those he converses with as if they
were his porters or his customers: the prentice-boy is not yet wiped
out of him, and his imagination still hovers between his mansion
at —, and the work-house. Opposed to him and to every one
else, is K—, a radical reformer and logician, who makes clear
work of the taxes and national debt, reconstructs the Government
from the first principles of things, shatters the Holy Alliance at a
blow, grinds out the future prospects of society with a machine,
and is setting out afresh with the commencement of the French
Revolution five and twenty years ago, as if on an untried experiment.
He minds nothing but the formal agreement of his premises and
his conclusions, and does not stick at obstacles in the way nor
consequences in the end. If there was but one side of a question,
he would be always in the right. He casts up one column of the
account to admiration, but totally forgets and rejects the other.
His ideas lie like square pieces of wood in his brain, and may be
said to be piled up on a stiff architectural principle, perpendicularly,
and at right angles. There is no inflection, no modification, no
graceful embellishment, no Corinthian capitals. I never heard him
agree to two propositions together, or to more than half a one at
a time. His rigid love of truth bends to nothing but his habitual
love of disputation. He puts one in mind of one of those long-headed
politicians and frequenters of coffee-houses mentioned in
Berkeley’s Minute Philosopher, who would make nothing of such
old-fashioned fellows as Plato and Aristotle. He has the new
light strong upon him, and he knocks other people down with its
solid beams. He denies that he has got certain views out of
Cobbett, though he allows that there are excellent ideas occasionally
to be met with in that writer. It is a pity that this enthusiastic
and unqualified regard to truth should be accompanied with an
equal exactness of expenditure and unrelenting eye to the main-chance.
He brings a bunch of radishes with him for cheapness,
and gives a band of musicians at the door a penny, observing that
he likes their performance better than all the Opera-squalling.
This brings the severity of his political principles into question,
if not into contempt. He would abolish the National Debt from
motives of personal economy, and objects to Mr. Canning’s pension
because it perhaps takes a farthing a year out of his own pocket.
A great deal of radical reasoning has its source in this feeling.—He
bestows no small quantity of his tediousness upon M—, on whose
mind all these formulas and diagrams fall like seed on stony ground:
‘while the manna is descending,’ he shakes his ears, and in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>intervals of the debate, insinuates an objection, and calls for another
half-pint. I have sometimes said to him—‘Any one to come in
here without knowing you, would take you for the most disputatious
man alive, for you are always engaged in an argument with somebody
or other.’ The truth is, that M— is a good-natured,
gentlemanly man, who notwithstanding, if appealed to, will not let
an absurd or unjust proposition pass without expressing his dissent;
and therefore he is a sort of mark for all those (and we have
several of that stamp) who like to teaze other people’s understandings,
as wool-combers teaze wool. He is certainly the flower
of the flock. He is the oldest frequenter of the place, the latest
sitter-up, well-informed, inobtrusive, and that sturdy old English
character, a lover of truth and justice. I never knew M—
approve of any thing unfair or illiberal. There is a candour and
uprightness about his mind which can neither be wheedled nor browbeat
into unjustifiable complaisance. He looks strait-forward as
he sits with his glass in his hand, turning neither to the right nor
the left, and I will venture to say that he has never had a sinister
object in view through life. Mrs. Battle (it is recorded in her
Opinions on Whist) could not make up her mind to use the word
‘<em>Go</em>.’ M— from long practice has got over this difficulty, and
uses it incessantly. It is no matter what adjunct follows in the
train of this despised monosyllable:—whatever liquid comes after
this prefix is welcome. M— without being the most communicative
is the most conversible man I know. The social
principle is inseparable from his person. If he has nothing to say,
he drinks your health; and when you cannot from the rapidity and
carelessness of his utterance catch what he says, you assent to it
with equal confidence: you know his meaning is good. His
favourite phrase is ‘We have all of us something of the coxcomb;’
and yet he has none of it himself. Before I had exchanged half
a dozen sentences with M—, I found that he knew several of
my old acquaintance (an immediate introduction of itself, for the
discussing the characters and foibles of common friends is a great
sweetener and cement of friendship)—and had been intimate with
most of the wits and men about town for the last twenty years.
He knew Tobin, Wordsworth, Porson, Wilson, Paley, Erskine,
and many others. He speaks of Paley’s pleasantry and unassuming
manners, and describes Porson’s long potations and long quotations
formerly at the Cider-Cellar in a very lively way. He has doubts,
however, as to that sort of learning. On my saying that I had
never seen the Greek Professor but once, at the Library of the
London Institution, when he was dressed in an old rusty black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>coat, with cobwebs hanging to the skirts of it, and with a large
patch of coarse brown paper covering the whole length of his nose,
looking for all the world like a drunken carpenter, and talking to one
of the Proprietors with an air of suavity, approaching to condescension,
M— could not help expressing some little uneasiness
for the credit of classical literature. ‘I submit, Sir, whether
common sense is not the principal thing? What is the advantage
of genius and learning if they are of no use in the conduct of life?’—M—
is one who loves the hours that usher in the morn, when a
select few are left in twos and threes like stars before the break of
day, and when the discourse and the ale are ‘aye growing better
and better.’ W—, M—, and myself were all that remained
one evening. We had sat together several hours without being
tired of one another’s company. The conversation turned on the
Beauties of Charles the Second’s Court at Windsor, and from thence
to Count Grammont, their gallant and gay historian. We took our
favourite passages in turn—one preferring that of Killigrew’s country-cousin,
who having been resolutely refused by Miss Warminster (one
of the Maids of Honour) when he found she had been unexpectedly
brought to bed, fell on his knees and thanked God that now she
might take compassion on him—another insisting that the Chevalier
Hamilton’s assignation with Lady Chesterfield, when she kept him
all night shivering in an old out-house, was better. Jacob Hall’s
prowess was not forgotten, nor the story of Miss Stuart’s garters.
I was getting on in my way with that delicate <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">endroit</span></i>, in which
Miss Churchill is first introduced at court and is besieged (as a
matter of course) by the Duke of York, who was gallant as well
as bigoted on system. His assiduities however soon slackened,
owing (it is said) to her having a pale, thin face; till one day,
as they were riding out hunting together, she fell from her horse,
and was taken up almost lifeless. The whole assembled court were
thrown by this event into admiration that such a body should belong
to such a face<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> (so transcendant a pattern was she of the female
form) and the Duke was fixed. This I contended was striking,
affecting, and grand, the sublime of amorous biography, and said I
could conceive of nothing finer than the idea of a young person in her
situation, who was the object of indifference or scorn from outward
appearance, with the proud suppressed consciousness of a Goddess-like
symmetry, locked up by ‘fear and niceness, the hand-maids of
all women,’ from the wonder and worship of mankind. I said so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>then, and I think so now: my tongue grew wanton in the praise of
this passage, and I believe it bore the bell from its competitors.
W— then spoke of Lucius Apuleius and his Golden Ass, which
contains the story of Cupid and Psyche, with other matter rich and
rare, and went on to the romance of Heliodorus, Theagenes and
Chariclea. This, as he affirmed, opens with a pastoral landscape
equal to Claude, and in it the presiding deities of Love and Wine
appear in all their pristine strength, youth and grace, crowned and
worshipped as of yore. The night waned, but our glasses brightened,
enriched with the pearls of Grecian story. Our cup-bearer slept in
a corner of the room, like another Endymion, in the pale ray of an
half-extinguished lamp, and starting up at a fresh summons for a
farther supply, he swore it was too late, and was inexorable to
entreaty. M— sat with his hat on and with a hectic flush in his
face while any hope remained, but as soon as we rose to go, he
darted out of the room as quick as lightning, determined not to be
the last that went.—I said some time after to the waiter, that ‘Mr.
M— was no flincher.’—‘Oh! Sir,’ says he, ‘you should have
known him formerly, when Mr. H— and Mr. A— used to
be here. Now he is quite another man: he seldom stays later than
one or two.’—‘Why, did they keep it up much later then?’—Oh!
yes; and used to sing catches and all sorts.’—‘What, did
Mr. M— sing catches?’—‘He joined chorus, Sir, and was as
merry as the best of them. He was always a pleasant gentleman!’—This
H— and A— succumbed in the fight. A— was
a dry Scotchman, H— a good-natured, hearty Englishman. I do
not mean that the same character applies to all Scotchmen or to all
Englishmen. H— was of the Pipe-Office (not unfitly appointed),
and in his cheerfuller cups would delight to speak of a widow and a
bowling-green, that ran in his head to the last. ‘What is the good
of talking of those things now?’ said the man of utility. ‘I don’t
know,’ replied the other, quaffing another glass of sparkling ale, and
with a lambent fire playing in his eye and round his bald forehead—(he
had a head that Sir Joshua would have made something bland
and genial of)—‘I don’t know, but they were delightful to me at
the time, and are still pleasant to talk and think of.’—<em>Such a one</em>,
in Touchstone’s phrase, <em>is a natural philosopher</em>; and in nine cases out
of ten that sort of philosophy is the best! I could enlarge this
sketch, such as it is; but to prose on to the end of the chapter
might prove less profitable than tedious.—</p>

<p class='c013'>I like very well to sit in a room where there are people talking
on subjects I know nothing of, if I am only allowed to sit silent
and as a spectator. But I do not much like to join in the conversation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>except with people and on subjects to my taste. Sympathy
is necessary to society. To look on, a variety of faces, humours,
and opinions is sufficient: to mix with others, agreement as well as
variety is indispensable. What makes good society? I answer, in
one word, real fellowship. Without a similitude of tastes, acquirements,
and pursuits (whatever may be the difference of tempers and
characters) there can be no intimacy or even casual intercourse,
worth the having. What makes the most agreeable party? A
number of people with a number of ideas in common, ‘yet so as
with a difference;’ that is, who can put one or more subjects which
they have all studied in the greatest variety of entertaining or useful
lights. Or in other words, a succession of good things said with
good humour, and addressed to the understandings of those who hear
them, make the most desirable conversation. Ladies, lovers, beaux,
wits, philosophers, the fashionable or the vulgar, are the fittest company
for one another. The discourse at Randall’s is the best for
boxers: that at Long’s for lords and loungers. I prefer H—’s
conversation almost to any other person’s, because, with a familiar
range of subjects, he colours with a totally new and sparkling light,
reflected from his own character. Elia, the grave and witty, says
things not to be surpassed in essence: but the manner is more painful
and less a relief to my own thoughts. Some one conceived he could
not be an excellent companion, because he was seen walking down
the side of the Thames, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">passibus iniquis</span></i>, after dining at Richmond.
The objection was not valid. I will however admit that the said
Elia is the worst company in the world in bad company, if it be
granted me that in good company he is nearly the best that can be.
He is one of those of whom it may be said, <em>Tell me your company, and
I’ll tell you your manners</em>. He is the creature of sympathy, and
makes good whatever opinion you seem to entertain of him. He
cannot outgo the apprehensions of the circle; and invariably acts up
or down to the point of refinement or vulgarity at which they pitch
him. He appears to take a pleasure in exaggerating the prejudices
of strangers against him; a pride in confirming the prepossessions of
friends. In whatever scale of intellect he is placed, he is as lively
or as stupid as the rest can be for their lives. If you think him odd
and ridiculous, he becomes more and more so every minute, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la folie</span></i>,
till he is a wonder gazed by all—set him against a good wit and a
ready apprehension, and he brightens more and more—</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>We had a pleasant party one evening at B— C—’s. A young
literary bookseller who was present went away delighted with the
elegance of the repast, and spoke in raptures of a servant in green
livery and a patent-lamp. I thought myself that the charm of the
evening consisted in some talk about Beaumont and Fletcher and
the old poets, in which every one took part or interest, and in a
consciousness that we could not pay our host a better compliment
than in thus alluding to studies in which he excelled, and in praising
authors whom he had imitated with feeling and sweetness!—I should
think it may be also laid down as a rule on this subject, that to constitute
good company a certain proportion of hearers and speakers is
requisite. Coleridge makes good company for this reason. He
immediately establishes the principle of the division of labour in this
respect, wherever he comes. He takes his cue as speaker, and the
rest of the party theirs as listeners—a ‘Circean herd’—without any
previous arrangement having been gone through. I will just add
that there can be no good society without perfect freedom from
affectation and constraint. If the unreserved communication of
feeling or opinion leads to offensive familiarity, it is not well. But
it is no better where the absence of offensive remarks arises only
from formality and an assumed respectfulness of manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not think there is any thing deserving the name of society to
be found out of London: and that for the two following reasons.
First, there is <em>neighbourhood</em> elsewhere, accidental or unavoidable
acquaintance: people are thrown together by chance or grow together
like trees; but you can pick your society nowhere but in
London. The very persons that of all others you would wish to
associate with in almost every line of life, (or at least of intellectual
pursuit,) are to be met with there. It is hard if out of a million of
people you cannot find half a dozen to your liking. Individuals may
seem lost and hid in the size of the place: but in fact from this very
circumstance you are within two or three miles’ reach of persons
that without it you would be some hundreds apart from. Secondly,
London is the only place in which each individual in company is
treated according to his value in company, and to that only. In
every other part of the kingdom he carries another character about
with him, which supersedes the intellectual or social one. It is
known in Manchester or Liverpool what every man in the room is
worth in land or money; what are his connexions and prospects in
life—and this gives a character of servility or arrogance, of mercenariness
or impertinence to the whole of provincial intercourse. You
laugh not in proportion to a man’s wit, but his wealth: you have to
consider not what, but whom you contradict. You speak by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>pound, and are heard by the rood. In the metropolis there is neither
time nor inclination for these remote calculations. Every man
depends on the quantity of sense, wit, or good manners he brings
into society for the reception he meets with in it. A member of
parliament soon finds his level as a commoner: the merchant and
manufacturer cannot bring his goods to market here: the great
landed proprietor shrinks from being the lord of acres into a pleasant
companion or a dull fellow. When a visitor enters or leaves a room,
it is not inquired whether he is rich or poor, whether he lives in a
garret or a palace, or comes in his own or a hackney-coach, but
whether he has a good expression of countenance, with an unaffected
manner, and whether he is a man of understanding or a blockhead.
These are the circumstances by which you make a favourable impression
on the company, and by which they estimate you in the
abstract. In the country, they consider whether you have a vote at
the next election, or a place in your gift; and measure the capacity
of others to instruct or entertain them by the strength of their
pockets and their credit with their banker. Personal merit is at a
prodigious discount in the provinces. I like the country very well,
if I want to enjoy my own company: but London is the only place
for equal society, or where a man can say a good thing or express
an honest opinion without subjecting himself to being insulted, unless
he first lays his purse on the table to back his pretensions to talent or
independence of spirit. I speak from experience.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XXI<br /> <span class='small'>ON THE ARISTOCRACY OF LETTERS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>‘Ha! here’s three of us are sophisticated:—off, you lendings.’—</p>

<p class='c013'>There is such a thing as an aristocracy or privileged order in letters,
which has sometimes excited my wonder, and sometimes my spleen.
We meet with authors who have never done any thing, but who have
a vast reputation for what they could have done. Their names stand
high, and are in every body’s mouth, but their works are never heard
of, or had better remain undiscovered for the sake of their admirers.—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stat
nominis umbra</span></i>—their pretensions are lofty and unlimited, as
they have nothing to rest upon, or because it is impossible to confront
them with the proofs of their deficiency. If you inquire farther, and
insist upon some act of authorship to establish the claims of these
Epicurean votaries of the Muses, you find that they had a great
reputation at Cambridge, that they were senior wranglers or successful
prize-essayists, that they visit at — House, and to support that
honour, must be supposed of course to occupy the first rank in the
world of letters.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a> It is possible, however, that they have some
manuscript work in hand, which is of too much importance (and the
writer has too much at stake in publishing it) hastily to see the light:
or perhaps they once had an article in the Edinburgh Review, which
was much admired at the time, and is kept by them ever since as a
kind of diploma and unquestionable testimonial of merit. They are
not like Grub-street authors, who write for bread, and are paid by the
sheet. Like misers who hoard their wealth, they are supposed to be
masters of all the wit and sense they do not impart to the public.
‘Continents have most of what they contain,’ says a considerable
philosopher; and these persons, it must be confessed, have a prodigious
command over themselves in the expenditure of light and
learning. The Oriental curse—‘O that mine enemy had written a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>book’—hangs suspended over them. By never committing themselves,
they neither give a handle to the malice of the world, nor
excite the jealousy of friends; and keep all the reputation they have
got, not by discreetly blotting, but by never writing a line. Some
one told Sheridan, who was always busy about some new work and
never advancing any farther in it, that he would not write because he
was afraid of the Author of the School for Scandal. So these idle
pretenders are afraid of undergoing a comparison with themselves in
something they have never done, but have had credit for doing.
They do not acquire celebrity, they assume it; and escape detection
by never venturing out of their imposing and mysterious <em>incognito</em>.
They do not let themselves down by every-day work: for them to
appear in print is a work of supererogation as much as in lords or
kings, and like gentlemen with a large landed estate, they live on their
established character, and do nothing (or as little as possible) to
increase or lose it. There is not a more deliberate piece of grave
imposture going. I know a person of this description who has been
employed many years (by implication) on a translation of Thucydides,
of which no one ever saw a word, but it does not answer the purpose
of bolstering up a factitious reputation the less on that account. The
longer it is delayed and kept sacred from the vulgar gaze, the more it
swells into imaginary consequence; the labour and care required for
a work of this kind being immense:—and then there are no faults in
an unexecuted translation. The only impeccable writers are those
who never wrote. Another is an oracle on subjects of taste and
classical erudition, because (he says at least) he reads Cicero once a
year to keep up the purity of his Latinity. A third makes the
indecency pass for the depth of his researches and for a high gusto in
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">virtù</span></i>, till from his seeing nothing in the finest remains of ancient art,
the world by the merest accident find out that there is nothing in him.
There is scarcely any thing that a grave face with an impenetrable
manner will not accomplish, and whoever is weak enough to impose
upon himself, will have wit enough to impose upon the public—particularly
if he can make it their interest to be deceived by shallow
boasting, and contrives not to hurt their self-love by sterling acquirements.
Do you suppose that the understood translation of Thucydides
costs its supposed author nothing? A select party of friends
and admirers dine with him once a week at a magnificent town-mansion,
or a more elegant and picturesque retreat in the country.
They broach their Horace and their old hock, and sometimes allude
with a considerable degree of candour to the defects of works which
are brought out by contemporary writers—the ephemeral offspring of
haste and necessity!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Among other things, the learned languages are a ready passport to
this sort of unmeaning, unanalysed reputation. They presently lift a
man up among the celestial constellations, the signs of the Zodiac (as
it were) and third heaven of inspiration, from whence he looks down
on those who are toiling on in this lower sphere, and earning their
bread by the sweat of their brain, at leisure and in scorn. If the
graduates in this way condescend to express their thoughts in English,
it is understood to be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">infra dignitatem</span></i>—such light and unaccustomed
essays do not fit the ponderous gravity of their pen—they only draw
to advantage and with full justice to themselves in the bow of the
ancients. Their native-tongue is to them strange, inelegant, unapt,
and crude. They ‘cannot command it to any utterance of harmony.
They have not the skill.’ This is true enough; but you must not
say so, under a heavy penalty—the displeasure of pedants and blockheads.
It would be sacrilege against the privileged classes, the
Aristocracy of Letters. What! will you affirm that a profound
Latin scholar, a perfect Grecian, cannot write a page of common
sense or grammar? Is it not to be presumed, by all the charters of
the Universities and the foundations of grammar-schools, that he who
can speak a dead language must be <em>a fortiori</em> conversant with his own?
Surely, the greater implies the less. He who knows every science
and every art cannot be ignorant of the most familiar forms of speech.
Or if this plea is found not to hold water, then our scholastic bungler
is said to be above this vulgar trial of skill, ‘something must be
excused to want of practice—but did you not observe the elegance of
the Latinity, how well that period would become a classical and
studied dress?’ Thus defects are ‘monster’d’ into excellences, and
they screen their idol, and require you, at your peril, to pay prescriptive
homage to false concords and inconsequential criticisms,
because the writer of them has the character of the first or second
Greek or Latin scholar in the kingdom. If you do not swear to the
truth of these spurious credentials, you are ignorant and malicious, a
quack and a scribbler—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">flagranti delicto</span></i>! Thus the man who can
merely read and construe some old author is of a class superior to any
living one, and, by parity of reasoning, to those old authors themselves:
the poet or prose-writer of true and original genius, by the
courtesy of custom, ‘ducks to the learned fool:’ or as the author of
Hudibras has so well stated the same thing,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—‘He that is but able to express</div>
      <div class='line'>No sense at all in several languages,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will pass for learneder than he that’s known</div>
      <div class='line'>To speak the strongest reason in his own.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>These preposterous and unfounded claims of mere scholars to precedence
in the commonwealth of letters, which they set up so
formally themselves and which others so readily bow to, are partly
owing to traditional prejudice:—there was a time when learning was
the only distinction from ignorance, and when there was no such
thing as popular English literature. Again, there is something more
palpable and positive in this kind of acquired knowledge, like acquired
wealth, which the vulgar easily recognise. That others know the
meaning of signs which they are confessedly and altogether ignorant
of, is to them both a matter of fact and a subject of endless wonder.
The languages are worn like a dress by a man, and distinguish him
sooner than his natural figure; and we are, from motives of self-love,
inclined to give others credit for the ideas they have borrowed or
have come into indirect possession of, rather than for those that
originally belong to them and are exclusively their own. The merit
in them and the implied inferiority in ourselves is less. Learning is
a kind of external appendage or transferable property—</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘’Twas mine, ’tis his, and may be any man’s’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Genius and understanding are a man’s self, an integrant part of his
personal identity; and the title to these last, as it is the most difficult
to be ascertained, is also the most grudgingly acknowledged. Few
persons would pretend to deny that Porson had more Greek than
they. It was a question of fact which might be put to the immediate
proof, and could not be gainsaid. But the meanest frequenter of the
Cider-cellar or the Hole in the Wall would be inclined, in his own
conceit, to dispute the palm of wit or sense with him; and indemnify
his self-complacency for the admiration paid to living learning by
significant hints to friends and casual droppers-in, that the greatest
men, when you came to know them, were not without their weak
sides as well as others.—Pedants, I will add here, talk to the vulgar
as pedagogues talk to school-boys, on an understood principle of
condescension and superiority, and therefore make little progress in
the knowledge of men or things. While they fancy they are
accommodating themselves to, or else assuming airs of importance
over, inferior capacities, these inferior capacities are really laughing
at them. There can be no true superiority but what arises out
of the presupposed ground of equality: there can be no improvement
but from the free communication and comparing of ideas. Kings
and nobles, for this reason, receive little benefit from society—where
all is submission on one side, and condescension on the other. The
mind strikes out truth by collision, as steel strikes fire from the flint!</p>

<p class='c013'>There are whole families who are born classical, and are entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>in the heralds’ college of reputation by the right of consanguinity.
Literature, like nobility, runs in the blood. There is the B—
family. There is no end of it or its pretensions. It produces wits,
scholars, novelists, musicians, artists in ‘numbers numberless.’ The
name is alone a passport to the Temple of Fame. Those who bear
it are free of Parnassus by birth-right. The founder of it was himself
an historian and a musician, but more of a courtier and man of the
world than either. The secret of his success may perhaps be discovered
in the following passage, where, in alluding to three eminent
performers on different instruments, he says, ‘These three illustrious
personages were introduced at the Emperour’s court,’ &amp;c.; speaking
of them as if they were foreign ambassadours or princes of the blood,
and thus magnifying himself and his profession. This overshadowing
manner carries nearly every thing before it, and mystifies a great
many. There is nothing like putting the best face upon things, and
leaving others to find out the difference. He who could call three
musicians ‘personages,’ would himself play a personage through life,
and succeed in his leading object. Sir Joshua Reynolds, remarking
on this passage, said, ‘No one had a greater respect than he had for
his profession, but that he should never think of applying to it epithets
that were appropriated merely to external rank and distinction.’
Madame D—, it must be owned, had cleverness enough to stock
a whole family, and to set up her cousin-germans, male and female,
for wits and virtuosos to the third and fourth generation. The rest
have done nothing, that I know of, but keep up the name.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most celebrated author in modern times has written without
a name, and has been knighted for anonymous productions. Lord
Byron complains that Horace Walpole was not properly appreciated,
‘first, because he was a gentleman, and secondly, because he was a
nobleman.’ His Lordship stands in one, at least, of the predicaments
here mentioned, and yet he has had justice, or somewhat more,
done him. He towers above his fellows by all the height of the
peerage. If the poet lends a grace to the nobleman, the nobleman
pays it back to the poet with interest. What a fine addition is ten
thousand a year and a title to the flaunting pretensions of a modern
rhapsodist! His name so accompanied becomes the mouth well: it
is repeated thousands of times, instead of hundreds, because the reader
in being familiar with the Poet’s works seems to claim acquaintance
with the Lord,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Let but a lord once own the happy lines:</div>
      <div class='line'>How the wit brightens, and the style refines!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He smiles at the high-flown praise or petty cavils of little men. Does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>he make a slip in decorum, which Milton declares to be the principal
thing? His proud crest and armorial bearings support him:—no
bend-sinister slurs his poetical escutcheon! Is he dull, or does he
put off some trashy production on the public? It is not charged to
his account, as a deficiency which he must make good at the peril of
his admirers. His Lordship is not answerable for the negligence
or extravagances of his Muse. He ‘bears a charmed reputation,
which must not yield’ like one of vulgar birth. The Noble Bard
is for this reason scarcely vulnerable to the critics. The double
barrier of his pretensions baffles their puny, timid efforts. Strip off
some of his tarnished laurels, and the coronet appears glittering
beneath: restore them, and it still shines through with keener lustre.
In fact, his Lordship’s blaze of reputation culminates from his rank
and place in society. He sustains two lofty and imposing characters;
and in order to simplify the process of our admiration, and ‘leave no
rubs or botches in the way,’ we equalise his pretensions, and take it
for granted that he must be as superior to other men in genius as he
is in birth. Or, to give a more familiar solution of the enigma, the
Poet and the Peer agree to honour each other’s acceptances on the
bank of Fame, and sometimes cozen the town to some tune between
them.—Really, however, and with all his privileges, Lord Byron
might as well not have written that strange letter about Pope. I
could not afford it, poor as I am. Why does he pronounce, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
cathedrâ</span></i> and robed, that Cowper is no poet? Cowper was a gentleman
and of noble family like his critic. He was a teacher of morality
as well as a describer of nature, which is more than his Lordship is.
His John Gilpin will last as long as Beppo, and his verses to Mary
are not less touching than the Farewell. If I had ventured upon
such an assertion as this, it would have been worse for me than finding
out a borrowed line in the Pleasures of Hope.—</p>

<p class='c013'>There is not a more helpless or more despised animal than a mere
author, without any extrinsic advantages of birth, breeding, or fortune
to set him off. The real ore of talents or learning must be stamped
before it will pass current. To be at all looked upon as an author, a
man must be something more or less than an author—a rich merchant,
a banker, a lord, or a ploughman. He is admired for something
foreign to himself, that acts as a bribe to the servility or a set-off
to the envy of the community. ‘What should such fellows as we
do, crawling betwixt heaven and earth;’—‘coining our hearts for
drachmas;’ now scorched in the sun, now shivering in the breeze,
now coming out in our newest gloss and best attire, like swallows in
the spring, now ‘sent back like hallowmas or shortest day?’ The
best wits, like the handsomest faces <em>upon the town</em>, lead a harassing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>precarious life—are taken up for the bud and promise of talent, which
they no sooner fulfil than they are thrown aside like an old fashion—are
caressed without reason, and insulted with impunity—are subject
to all the caprice, the malice, and fulsome advances of that great
keeper, the Public—and in the end come to no good, like all those
who lavish their favours on mankind at large and look to the gratitude
of the world for their reward. Instead of this set of Grub-street
authors, the mere <em>canaille</em> of letters, this corporation of Mendicity,
this ragged regiment of genius suing at the corners of streets, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in forma
pauperis</span></i>, give me the gentleman and scholar, with a good house over
his head and a handsome table ‘with wine of Attic taste’ to ask his
friends to, and where want and sorrow never come. Fill up the
sparkling bowl, heap high the dessert with roses crowned, bring out
the hot-pressed poem, the vellum manuscripts, the medals, the portfolios,
the intaglios—this is the true model of the life of a man of
taste and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">virtù</span></i>—the possessors, not the inventors of these things, are
the true benefactors of mankind and ornaments of letters. Look in,
and there, amidst silver services and shining chandeliers, you will see
the man of genius at his proper post, picking his teeth and mincing
an opinion, sheltered by rank, bowing to wealth—a poet framed,
glazed, and hung in a striking light: not a straggling weed, torn and
trampled on; not a poor <em>Kit-run-the-street</em>, but a powdered beau, a
sycophant plant, an exotic reared in a glass-case, hermetically sealed,</p>

<p class='c015'>whose mealy coat no moth can corrupt nor blight can wither. The
poet Keats had not this sort of protection for his person—he lay bare
to weather—the serpent stung him, and the poison-tree dropped upon
this little western flower:—when the mercenary servile crew
approached him, he had no pedigree to show them, no rent-roll to
hold out in reversion for their praise: he was not in any great man’s
train, nor the butt and puppet of a lord—he could only offer them
‘the fairest flowers of the season, carnations and streaked gilliflowers,’—‘rue
for remembrance and pansies for thoughts’—they recked not
of his gift, but tore him with hideous shouts and laughter,</p>

<p class='c013'>Unless an author has an establishment of his own, or is entered on
that of some other person, he will hardly be allowed to write English
or to spell his own name. To be well-spoken of, he must enlist under
some standard; he must belong to some <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coterie</span></i>. He must get the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> on his side: he must have literary bail in readiness.
Thus they prop one another’s ricketty heads at M—’s shop, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>spurious reputation, like false argument, runs in a circle. Cr—k—r
affirms that G—ff—rd is sprightly, and G—ff—rd that Cr—k—r is
genteel: D’I— that J—c—b is wise, and J—c—b that D’I— is
good-natured. A member of Parliament must be answerable that
you are not dangerous or dull before you can be of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span></i>. You
must commence toad-eater to have your observations attended to; if
you are independent, unconnected, you will be regarded as a poor
creature. Your opinion is honest, you will say: then ten to one, it
is not profitable. It is at any rate your own. So much the worse;
for then it is not the world’s. T— is a very tolerable barometer
in this respect. He knows nothing, hears every thing, and repeats
just what he hears; so that you may guess pretty well from this
round-faced echo what is said by others! Almost every thing goes
by presumption and appearances. ‘Did you not think Mr. B—’s
language very elegant?’—I thought he bowed very low. ‘Did you
not think him remarkably well-behaved?’—He was unexceptionably
dressed. ‘But were not Mr. C—’s manners quite insinuating?’—He
said nothing. ‘You will at least allow his friend to be a well-informed
man?’—He talked upon all subjects alike. Such would
be a pretty faithful interpretation of the tone of what is called <em>good
society</em>. The surface is every thing: we do not pierce to the core.
The setting is more valuable than the jewel. Is it not so in other
things as well as letters? Is not an R.A. by the supposition a
greater man in his profession than any one who is not so blazoned?
Compared with that unrivalled list, Raphael had been illegitimate,
Claude not classical, and Michael Angelo admitted by special favour.
What is a physician without a diploma? An alderman without
being knighted? An actor whose name does not appear in great
letters? All others are counterfeits—men ‘of no mark or likelihood.’
This was what made the Jackalls of the North so eager to prove
that I had been turned out of the Edinburgh Review. It was not
the merit of the articles which excited their spleen—but their being
there. Of the style they knew nothing; for the thought they cared
nothing:—all that they knew was that I wrote in that powerful
journal, and therefore they asserted that I did not!</p>

<p class='c013'>We find a class of persons who labour under an obvious natural
inaptitude for whatever they aspire to. Their manner of setting
about it is a virtual disqualification. The simple affirmation—‘What
this man has said, I will do,’—is not always considered as the proper
test of capacity. On the contrary, there are people whose bare
pretensions are as good or better than the actual performance of
others. What I myself have done, for instance, I never find
admitted as proof of what I shall be able to do: whereas I observe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>others who bring as proof of their competence to any task (and are
taken at their word) what they have never done, and who gravely
assure those who are inclined to trust them that their talents are exactly
fitted for some post because they are just the reverse of what they
have ever shown them to be. One man has the air of an Editor as
much as another has that of a butler or porter in a gentleman’s
family.&nbsp;—— is the model of this character, with a prodigious look
of business, an air of suspicion which passes for sagacity, and an air
of deliberation which passes for judgment. If his own talents are no
ways prominent, it is inferred he will be more impartial and in earnest
in making use of those of others. There is&nbsp;——, the responsible
conductor of several works of taste and erudition, yet (God
knows) without an idea in his head relating to any one of them. He
is learned by proxy, and successful from sheer imbecility. If he
were to get the smallest smattering of the departments which are
under his controul, he would betray himself from his desire to shine;
but as it is, he leaves others to do all the drudgery for him. He
signs his name in the title-page or at the bottom of a vignette, and
nobody suspects any mistake. This contractor for useful and
ornamental literature once offered me Two Guineas for a Life and
Character of Shakespear, with an admission to his <em>conversationis</em>. I
went once. There was a collection of learned lumber, of antiquaries,
lexicographers, and other Illustrious Obscure, and I had given up the
day for lost, when in dropped Jack T. of the Sun—(Who would
dare to deny that he was ‘the Sun of our table?’)—and I had
nothing now to do but hear and laugh. Mr. T—— knows most of
the good things that have been said in the metropolis for the last
thirty years, and is in particular an excellent retailer of the humours
and extravagances of his old friend, Peter Pindar. He had recounted
a series of them, each rising above the other in a sort of magnificent
burlesque and want of literal preciseness, to a medley of laughing and
sour faces, when on his proceeding to state a joke of a practical
nature by the said Peter, a Mr.&nbsp;——, (I forget the name) objected
to the moral of the story, and to the whole texture of Mr. T——’s
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">facetiæ</span></i>—upon which our host, who had till now supposed that all was
going on swimmingly, thought it time to interfere and give a turn to
the conversation by saying—‘Why yes, Gentlemen, what we have
hitherto heard fall from the lips of our friend has been no doubt
entertaining and highly agreeable in its way: but perhaps we have
had enough of what is altogether delightful and pleasant and light
and laughable in conduct. Suppose, therefore, we were to shift the
subject, and talk of what is serious and moral and industrious and
laudable in character—Let us talk of Mr. Tomkins, the Penman!’—This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>staggered the gravest of us, broke up our dinner-party, and
we went up stairs  to tea. So much for the didactic vein of one of
our principal guides in the embellished walks of modern taste, and
master-manufacturers of letters. He had found that gravity had been
a never-failing resource when taken at a pinch—for once the joke
miscarried—and Mr. Tomkins the Penman figures to this day
nowhere but in Sir Joshua’s picture of him!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XXII<br /> <span class='small'>ON CRITICISM</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>Criticism is an art that undergoes a great variety of changes, and
aims at different objects at different times.</p>

<p class='c013'>At first, it is generally satisfied to give an opinion whether a work
is good or bad, and to quote a passage or two in support of this
opinion: afterwards, it is bound to assign the reasons of its decision
and to analyse supposed beauties or defects with microscopic
minuteness. A critic does nothing now-a-days who does not try to
torture the most obvious expression into a thousand meanings, and
enter into a circuitous explanation of all that can be urged for or
against its being in the best or worst style possible. His object
indeed is not to do justice to his author, whom he treats with very
little ceremony, but to do himself homage, and to show his acquaintance
with all the topics and resources of criticism. If he recurs to
the stipulated subject in the end, it is not till after he has exhausted
his budget of general knowledge; and he establishes his own claims
first in an elaborate inaugural dissertation <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de omni scibile et quibusdam
aliis</span></i>, before he deigns to bring forward the pretensions of the original
candidate for praise, who is only the second figure in the piece. We
may sometimes see articles of this sort, in which no allusion whatever
is made to the work under sentence of death, after the first announcement
of the title-page; and I apprehend it would be a clear improvement
on this species of nominal criticism, to give stated periodical
accounts of works that had never appeared at all, which would save
the hapless author the mortification of writing, and his reviewer the
trouble of reading them. If the real author is made of so little
account by the modern critic, he is scarcely more an object of regard
to the modern reader; and it must be confessed that after a dozen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>close-packed pages of subtle metaphysical distinction or solemn
didactic declamation, in which the disembodied principles of all arts
and sciences float before the imagination in undefined profusion,
the eye turns with impatience and indifference to the imperfect
embryo specimens of them, and the hopeless attempts to realise
this splendid jargon in one poor work by one poor author, which is
given up to summary execution with as little justice as pity. ‘As
when a well-graced actor leaves the stage, men’s eyes are idly bent on
him that enters next’—so it is here.—Whether this state of the
press is not a serious abuse and a violent encroachment in the republic
of letters, is more than I shall pretend to determine. The truth is,
that in the quantity of works that issue from the press, it is utterly
impossible they should all be read by all sorts of people. There
must be <em>tasters</em> for the public, who must have a discretionary power
vested in them, for which it is difficult to make them properly
accountable. Authors in proportion to their numbers become not
formidable, but despicable. They would not be heard of or severed
from the crowd without the critic’s aid, and all complaints of ill-treatment
are vain. He considers them as pensioners on his bounty
for any pittance of praise, and in general sets them up as butts for his
wit and spleen, or uses them as a stalking-horse to convey his own
favourite notions and opinions, which he can do by this means
without the possibility of censure or appeal. He looks upon his
literary <em>protegé</em> (much as Peter Pounce looked upon Parson Adams)
as a kind of humble companion or unnecessary interloper in the
vehicle of fame, whom he has taken up purely to oblige him, and
whom he may treat with neglect or insult, or set down in the common
foot-path, whenever it suits his humour or convenience. He naturally
grows arbitrary with the exercise of power. He by degrees wants to
have a clear stage to himself, and would be thought to have purchased
a monopoly of wit, learning, and wisdom—</p>

      <div class='line'>And seems to shake the spheres.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Besides, something of this overbearing manner goes a great way with
the public. They cannot exactly tell whether you are right or
wrong; and if you state your difficulties or pay much deference to
the sentiments of others, they will think you a very silly fellow or a
mere pretender. A sweeping, unqualified assertion ends all controversy,
and sets opinion at rest. A sharp, sententious, cavalier,
dogmatical tone is therefore necessary, even in self-defence, to the
office of a reviewer. If you do not deliver your oracles without
hesitation, how are the world to receive them on trust and without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>inquiry? People read to have something to talk about, and ‘to
seem to know that which they do not.’ Consequently, there cannot
be too much dialectics and debateable matter, too much pomp and
paradox in a review. <em>To elevate and surprise</em> is the great rule for
producing a dramatic or a critical effect. The more you startle the
reader, the more he will be able to startle others with a succession of
smart intellectual shocks. The most admired of our Reviews is
saturated with this sort of electrical matter, which is regularly played
off so as to produce a good deal of astonishment and a strong sensation
in the public mind. The intrinsic merits of an author are a question
of very subordinate consideration to the keeping up the character of
the work and supplying the town with a sufficient number of grave or
brilliant topics for the consumption of the next three months!</p>

<p class='c013'>This decided and paramount tone in criticism is the growth of the
present century, and was not at all the fashion in that calm peaceable
period when the Monthly Review bore ‘sole sovereign sway and
masterdom’ over all literary productions. Though nothing can be
said against the respectability or usefulness of that publication during
its long and almost exclusive enjoyment of the public favour, yet the
style of criticism adopted in it is such as to appear slight and unsatisfactory
to a modern reader. The writers, instead of ‘outdoing
termagant or out-Heroding Herod,’ were somewhat precise and
prudish, gentle almost to a fault, full of candour and modesty,</p>

<p class='c015'>There was none of that Drawcansir work going on then that there is
now; no scalping of authors, no hacking and hewing of their Lives
and Opinions, except that they used those of Tristram Shandy,
<span class='sc'>Gent.</span> rather scurvily; which was to be expected. All, however,
had a show of courtesy and good-manners. The satire was covert
and artfully insinuated; the praise was short and sweet. We meet
with no oracular theories; no profound analysis of principles; no
unsparing exposure of the least discernible deviation from them. It
was deemed sufficient to recommend the work in general terms, ‘This
is an agreeable volume,’ or ‘This is a work of great learning and
research,’ to set forth the title and table of contents, and proceed
without farther preface to some appropriate extracts, for the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>part concurring in opinion with the author’s text, but now and then
interposing an objection to maintain appearances and assert the
jurisdiction of the court. This cursory manner of hinting approbation
or dissent would make but a lame figure at present. We must
have not only an announcement that ‘this is an agreeable or able
work,’ but we must have it explained at full length, and so as to
silence all cavillers, in what the agreeableness or ability of the work
consists: the author must be reduced to a class, all the living or
defunct examples of which must be characteristically and pointedly
<em>differenced</em> from one another; the value of this class of writing must
be developed and ascertained in comparison with others; the
principles of taste, the elements of our sensations, the structure of the
human faculties, all must undergo a strict scrutiny and revision. The
modern or metaphysical system of criticism, in short, supposes the
question, <em>Why?</em> to be repeated at the end of every decision; and the
answer gives birth to interminable arguments and discussion. The
former laconic mode was well adapted to guide those who merely
wanted to be informed of the character and subject of a work in order
to read it: the present is more useful to those whose object is less to
read the work than to dispute upon its merits, and go into company
clad in the whole defensive and offensive armour of criticism.—</p>

<p class='c013'>Neither are we less removed at present from the dry and meagre
mode of dissecting the skeletons of works, instead of transfusing their
living principles, which prevailed in Dryden’s Prefaces,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a> and in the
criticisms written on the model of the French school about a century
ago. A genuine criticism should, as I take it, reflect the colours,
the light and shade, the soul and body of a work:—here we have
nothing but its superficial plan and elevation, as if a poem were a
piece of formal architecture. We are told something of the plot or
fable, of the moral, and of the observance or violation of the three
unities of time, place, and action; and perhaps a word or two is
added on the dignity of the persons or the baldness of the style: but
we no more know, after reading one of these complacent <em>tirades</em>,
what the essence of the work is, what passion has been touched, or
how skilfully, what tone and movement the author’s mind imparts to
his subject or receives from it, than if we had been reading a homily
or a gazette. That is, we are left quite in the dark as to the feelings
of pleasure or pain to be derived from the genius of the performance
or the manner in which it appeals to the imagination: we know to a
nicety how it squares with the thread-bare rules of composition, not
in the least how it affects the principles of taste. We know every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>thing about the work, and nothing of it. The critic takes good care
not to baulk the reader’s fancy by anticipating the effect which the
author has aimed at producing. To be sure, the works so handled
were often worthy of their commentators: they had the form of
imagination without the life or power; and when any one had gone
regularly through the number of acts into which they were divided,
the measure in which they were written, or the story on which they
were founded, there was little else to be said about them. It is
curious to observe the effect which the Paradise Lost had on this
class of critics, like throwing a tub to a whale: they could make
nothing of it. ‘It was out of all plumb—not one of the angles at the
four corners was a right angle!’ They did not seek for, nor would
they much relish the marrow of poetry it contained. Like polemics
in religion, they had discarded the essentials of fine writing for the
outward form and points of controversy. They were at issue with
Genius and Nature by what route and in what garb they should enter
the Temple of the Muses. Accordingly we find that Dryden had no
other way of satisfying himself of the pretensions of Milton in the
epic style but by translating his anomalous work into rhyme and
dramatic dialogue.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a>—So there are connoisseurs who give you the
subject, the grouping, the perspective, and all the mechanical circumstances
of a picture; but never say a word about the expression.
The reason is, they see the former, but not the latter. There are
persons, however, who cannot employ themselves better than in
taking an inventory of works of art (they want a faculty for higher
studies,) as there are works of art, so called, which seem to have
been composed expressly with an eye to such a class of connoisseurs.
In them are to be found no recondite nameless beauties thrown away
upon the stupid vulgar gaze; no ‘graces snatched beyond the reach
of art;’ nothing but what the merest pretender may note down in
good set terms in his common-place book, just as it is before him.
Place one of these half-informed, imperfectly organised spectators
before a tall canvas with groups on groups of figures, of the size of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>life, and engaged in a complicated action, of which they know the
name and all the particulars, and there are no bounds to their burst of
involuntary enthusiasm. They mount on the stilts of the subject and
ascend the highest Heaven of Invention, from whence they see sights
and hear revelations which they communicate with all the fervour of
plenary explanation to those who may be disposed to attend to their
raptures. They float with wings expanded in lofty circles, they
stalk over the canvas at large strides, never condescending to pause at
any thing of less magnitude than a group or a colossal figure. The
face forms no part of their collective inquiries; or so that it occupies
only a sixth or an eighth proportion to the whole body, all is
according to the received rules of composition. Point to a divine
portrait of Titian, to an angelic head of Guido, close by—they see
and heed it not. What are the ‘looks commercing with the skies,’
the soul speaking in the face, to them? It asks another and an inner
sense to comprehend them; but for the trigonometry of painting, nature
has constituted them indifferently well. They take a stand on the distinction
between portrait and history, and there they are spell-bound.
Tell them that there can be no fine history without portraiture, that the
painter must proceed from that ground to the one above it, and that a
hundred bad heads cannot make one good historical picture, and they
will not believe you, though the thing is obvious to any gross capacity.
Their ideas always fly to the circumference, and never fix at the
centre. Art must be on a grand scale; according to them, the whole
is greater than a part, and the greater necessarily implies the less.
The outline is in this view of the matter the same thing as the filling-up,
and ‘the limbs and flourishes of a discourse’ the substance.
Again, the same persons make an absolute distinction, without
knowing why, between high and low subjects. Say that you would
as soon have Murillo’s <cite>Two Beggar-Boys</cite> at the Dulwich Gallery as
almost any picture in the world, that is, that it would be one you
would chuse out of ten (had you the choice), and they reiterate upon
you, that surely a low subject cannot be of equal value with a high
one. It is in vain that you turn to the picture: they keep to the
class. They have eyes, but see not; and upon their principles of
refined taste, would be just as good judges of the merit of the
picture without seeing it as with that supposed advantage. They
know what the subject is <em>from the catalogue</em>!—Yet it is not true, as
Lord Byron asserts, that execution is every thing, and the class or
subject nothing. The highest subjects, equally well-executed (which,
however, rarely happens) are the best. But the power of execution,
the manner of seeing nature, is one thing, and may be so superlative
(if you are only able to judge of it) as to countervail every disadvantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>of subject. Raphael’s storks in the Miraculous Draught
of Fishes, exulting in the event, are finer than the head of Christ
would have been in almost any other hands. The cant of criticism
is on the other side of the question; because execution depends
on various degrees of power in the artist, and a knowledge of it on
various degrees of feeling and discrimination in you: but to commence
artist or connoisseur in the grand style at once, without any distinction
of qualification whatever, it is only necessary for the first to
chuse his subject, and for the last to pin his faith on the sublimity
of the performance, for both to look down with ineffable contempt
on the painters and admirers of subjects of low life. I remember a
young Scotchman once trying to prove to me that Mrs. Dickons was
a superior singer to Miss Stephens, because the former excelled in
sacred music, and the latter did not. At that rate, that is, if it is
the singing sacred music that gives the preference, Miss Stephens
would only have to sing sacred music to surpass herself and vie with
her pretended rival; for this theory implies that all sacred music is
equally good, and therefore better than any other. I grant that
Madame Catalani’s singing of sacred music is superior to Miss
Stephens’s ballad-strains, because her singing is better altogether,
and an ocean of sound more wonderful than a simple stream of
dulcet harmonies. In singing the last verse of ‘God save the
King’ not long ago, her voice towered above the whole confused
noise of the orchestra, like an eagle piercing the clouds, and poured
‘such sweet thunder’ through the ear, as excited equal astonishment
and rapture!</p>

<p class='c013'>Some kinds of criticism are as much too insipid as others are too
pragmatical. It is not easy to combine point with solidity, spirit
with moderation and candour. Many persons see nothing but beauties
in a work, others nothing but defects. Those cloy you with sweets,
and are ‘the very milk of human kindness,’ flowing on in a stream of
luscious panegyrics; these take delight in poisoning the sources of
your satisfaction, and putting you out of conceit with nearly every
author that comes in their way. The first are frequently actuated by
personal friendship, the last by all the virulence of party-spirit. Under
the latter head would fall what may be termed <em>political criticism</em>. The
basis of this style of writing is a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i> of impotent spite and
dulness, till it is varnished over with the slime of servility, and thrown
into a state of unnatural activity by the venom of the most rancorous
bigotry. The eminent professors in this groveling department are at
first merely out of sorts with themselves, and vent their spleen in little
interjections and contortions of phrase:—cry <em>Pish</em> at a lucky hit, and
<em>Hem</em> at a fault, are smart on personal defects, and sneer at ‘Beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>out of favour and on crutches’—are thrown into an ague-fit by
hearing the name of a rival, start back with horror at any approach
to their morbid pretensions like Justice Woodcock with his gouty
limbs—rifle the flowers of the Della Cruscan school, and give you
in their stead, as models of a pleasing pastoral style, Verses upon
Anna—which you may see in the notes to the Baviad and Mæviad.
All this is like the fable of the <cite>Kitten and the Leaves</cite>. But when
they get their brass collar on and shake their bells of office, they set
up their backs like the Great Cat Rodilardus, and pounce upon men
and things. Woe to any little heedless reptile of an author that
ventures across their path without a safe-conduct from the Board of
Controul. They snap him up at a mouthful, and sit licking their
lips, stroking their whiskers, and rattling their bells over the imaginary
fragments of their devoted prey, to the alarm and astonishment of the
whole breed of literary, philosophical, and revolutionary vermin, that
were naturalised in this country by a Prince of Orange and an Elector
of Hanover a hundred years ago.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a> When one of these pampered,
sleek, ‘demure-looking, spring-nailed, velvet-pawed, green-eyed’ critics
makes his King and Country parties to this sort of sport literary, you
have not much chance of escaping out of his clutches in a whole skin.
Treachery becomes a principle with them, and mischief a conscience,
that is, a livelihood. They not only <em>damn</em> the work in the lump,
but vilify and traduce the author, and substitute lying abuse and
sheer malignity for sense and satire. To have written a popular
work is as much as a man’s character is worth, and sometimes his
life, if he does not happen to be on the right side of the question.
The way in which they set about <em>stultifying</em> an adversary is not to
accuse you of faults, or to exaggerate those which you may really
have, but they deny that you have any merits at all, least of all,
those that the world have given you credit for; bless themselves
from understanding a single sentence in a whole volume; and unless
you are ready to subscribe to all their articles of peace, will not
allow you to be qualified to write your own name. It is not a
question of literary discussion, but of political proscription. It is
a mark of loyalty and patriotism to extend no quarter to those of
the opposite party. Instead of replying to your arguments, they
call you names, put words and opinions into your mouth which you
have never uttered, and consider it a species of misprision of treason
to admit that a Whig author knows any thing of common sense or
English. The only chance of putting a stop to this unfair mode
of dealing would perhaps be to make a few reprisals by way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>example. The Court-party boast some writers who have a reputation
to lose, and who would not like to have their names dragged
through the kennel of dirty abuse and vulgar obloquy. What
silenced the masked battery of Blackwood’s Magazine was the
implication of the name of Sir Walter Scott in some remarks upon
it—(an honour of which it seems that extraordinary person was not
ambitious)—to be ‘pilloried on infamy’s high stage’ was a distinction
and an amusement to the other gentlemen concerned in that
praiseworthy publication. I was complaining not long ago of this
prostitution of literary criticism as peculiar to our own times, when
I was told that it was just as bad in the time of Pope and Dryden,
and indeed worse, inasmuch as we have no Popes or Drydens now
on the obnoxious side to be nicknamed, metamorphosed into scarecrows,
and impaled alive by bigots and dunces. I shall not pretend
to say how far this remark may be true. The English (it must be
owned) are rather a foul-mouthed nation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides temporary or accidental biases of this kind, there seem to
be sects and parties in taste and criticism (with a set of appropriate
watch-words) coeval with the arts of composition, and that will last
as long as the difference with which men’s minds are originally
constituted. There are some who are all for the elegance of an
author’s style, and some who are equally delighted with simplicity.
The last refer you to Swift as a model of English prose—thinking
all other writers sophisticated and naught—the former prefer the
more ornamented and sparkling periods of Junius or Gibbon. It is
to no purpose to think of bringing about an understanding between
these opposite factions. It is a natural difference of temperament
and constitution of mind. The one will never relish the antithetical
point and perpetual glitter of the artificial prose-style; as the plain
unperverted English idiom will always appear trite and insipid to the
others. A toleration, not an uniformity of opinion is as much as
can be expected in this case: and both sides may acknowledge,
without imputation on their taste or consistency, that these different
writers excelled each in their way. I might remark here that the
epithet <em>elegant</em> is very sparingly used in modern criticism. It has
probably gone out of fashion with the appearance of the <em>Lake School</em>,
who, I apprehend, have no such phrase in their vocabulary. Mr.
Rogers was, I think, almost the last poet to whom it was applied as
a characteristic compliment. At present it would be considered as a
sort of diminutive of the title of poet, like the terms <em>pretty</em> or <em>fanciful</em>,
and is banished from the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haut ton</span></i> of letters. It may perhaps come
into request at some future period.—Again, the dispute between the
admirers of Homer and Virgil has never been settled, and never will:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>for there will always be minds to whom the excellences of Virgil
will be more congenial, and therefore more objects of admiration and
delight than those of Homer, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>. Both are right in
preferring what suits them best, the delicacy and selectness of the
one, or the fulness and majestic flow of the other. There is
the same difference in their taste that there was in the genius of
their two favourites. Neither can the disagreement between the
French and English school of tragedy ever be reconciled, till the
French become English, or the English French.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a> Both are right
in what they admire, both are wrong in condemning the others for
what they admire. We see the defects of Racine, they see the faults
of Shakespear probably in an exaggerated point of view. But we
may be sure of this, that when we see nothing but grossness and
barbarism, or insipidity and verbiage in a writer that is the God of a
nation’s idolatry, it is we and not they who want true taste and feeling.
The controversy about Pope and the opposite school in our own
poetry comes to much the same thing. Pope’s correctness, smoothness,
&amp;c. are very good things and much to be commended in him.
But it is not to be expected or even desired that others should have
these qualities in the same paramount degree, to the exclusion of
every thing else. If you like correctness and smoothness of all things
in the world, there they are for you in Pope. If you like other
things better, such as strength and sublimity, you know where to go
for them. Why trouble Pope or any other author for what they
have not, and do not profess to give? Those who seem to imply
that Pope possessed, besides his own peculiar, exquisite merits, all
that is to be found in Shakespear or Milton, are I should hardly
think in good earnest. But I do not therefore see that, because this
was not the case, Pope was no poet. We cannot by a little verbal
sophistry confound the qualities of different minds, nor force opposite
excellences into a union by all the intolerance in the world. We
may pull Pope in pieces as long as we please, for not being Shakespear
or Milton, as we may carp at them for not being Pope: but this will
not make a poet equal to all three. If we have a taste for some one
precise style or manner, we may keep it to ourselves and let others
have theirs. If we are more catholic in our notions, and want variety
of excellence and beauty, it is spread abroad for us to profusion in the
variety of books and in the several growth of men’s minds, fettered
by no capricious or arbitrary rules. Those who would proscribe
whatever falls short of a given standard of imaginary perfection, do
so not from a higher capacity of taste or range of intellect than others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>but to destroy, to ‘crib and cabin in,’ all enjoyments and opinions but
their own.</p>

<p class='c013'>We find people of a decided and original, and others of a more
general and versatile taste. I have sometimes thought that the most
acute and original-minded men made bad critics. They see every
thing too much through a particular medium. What does not fall in
with their own bias and mode of composition, strikes them as common-place
and factitious. What does not come into the direct line of their
vision, they regard idly, with vacant, ‘lack-lustre eye.’ The extreme
force of their original impressions compared with the feebleness of
those they receive at second hand from others, oversets the balance
and just proportion of their minds. Men who have fewer native
resources, and are obliged to apply oftener to the general stock,
acquire by habit a greater aptitude in appreciating what they owe to
others. Their taste is not made a sacrifice to their egotism and
vanity, and they enrich the soil of their minds with continual accessions
of borrowed strength and beauty. I might take this opportunity
of observing, that the person of the most refined and least contracted
taste I ever knew was the late Joseph Fawcett, the friend of my
youth. He was almost the first literary acquaintance I ever made,
and I think the most candid and unsophisticated. He had a masterly
perception of all styles and of every kind and degree of excellence,
sublime or beautiful, from Milton’s Paradise Lost to Shenstone’s
Pastoral Ballad, from Butler’s Analogy down to Humphry Clinker.
If you had a favourite author, he had read him too, and knew all the
best morsels, the subtle <em>traits</em>, the capital touches. ‘Do you like
Sterne?’—‘Yes, to be sure,’ he would say, ‘I should deserve to be
hanged, if I didn’t!’ His repeating some parts of Comus with his
fine, deep, mellow-toned voice, particularly the lines, ‘I have heard
my mother Circe with the Sirens three,’ &amp;c.—and the enthusiastic
comments he made afterwards were a feast to the ear and to the soul.
He read the poetry of Milton with the same fervour and spirit of
devotion that I have since heard others read their own. ‘That is the
most delicious feeling of all,’ I have heard him exclaim, ‘to like
what is excellent, no matter whose it is.’ In this respect he practised
what he preached. He was incapable of harbouring a sinister motive,
and judged only from what he felt. There was no flaw or mist in
the clear mirror of his mind. He was as open to impressions as he
was strenuous in maintaining them. He did not care a rush whether
a writer was old or new, in prose or in verse—‘What he wanted,’ he
said, ‘was something to make him think.’ Most men’s minds are to
me like musical instruments out of tune. Touch a particular key,
and it jars and makes harsh discord with your own. They like Gil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Blas, but can see nothing to laugh at in Don Quixote: they adore
Richardson, but are disgusted with Fielding. Fawcett had a taste
accommodated to all these. He was not exceptious. He gave a
cordial welcome to all sorts, provided they were the best in their
kind. He was not fond of counterfeits or duplicates. His own
style was laboured and artificial to a fault, while his character was
frank and ingenuous in the extreme. He was not the only individual
whom I have known to counteract their natural disposition in coming
before the public, and by avoiding what they perhaps thought an
inherent infirmity, debar themselves of their real strength and
advantages. A heartier friend or honester critic I never coped
withal. He has made me feel (by contrast) the want of genuine
sincerity and generous sentiment in some that I have listened to since,
and convinced me (if practical proof were wanting) of the truth of
that text of Scripture—‘That had I all knowledge and could speak
with the tongues of angels, yet without charity I were nothing!’ I
would rather be a man of disinterested taste and liberal feeling, to
see and acknowledge truth and beauty wherever I found it, than a
man of greater and more original genius, to hate, envy, and deny all
excellence but my own—but that poor scanty pittance of it
(compared with the whole) which I had myself produced!</p>

<p class='c013'>There is another race of critics who might be designated as the
<em>Occult School</em>—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">verè adepti</span></i>. They discern no beauties but what are
concealed from superficial eyes, and overlook all that are obvious to
the vulgar part of mankind. Their art is the transmutation of styles.
By happy alchemy of mind they convert dross into gold—and gold
into tinsel. They see farther into a millstone than most others. If
an author is utterly unreadable, they can read him for ever: his
intricacies are their delight, his mysteries are their study. They
prefer Sir Thomas Brown to the Rambler by Dr. Johnson, and
Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy to all the writers of the Georgian
Age. They judge of works of genius as misers do of hid treasure—it
is of no value unless they have it all to themselves. They will no
more share a book than a mistress with a friend. If they suspected
their favourite volumes of delighting any eyes but their own, they
would immediately discard them from the list. Theirs are superannuated
beauties that every one else has left off intriguing with,
bed-ridden hags, a ‘stud of night-mares.’ This is not envy or
affectation, but a natural proneness to singularity, a love of what is
odd and out of the way. They must come at their pleasures with
difficulty, and support admiration by an uneasy sense of ridicule and
opposition. They despise those qualities in a work which are cheap
and obvious. They like a monopoly of taste, and are shocked at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>prostitution of intellect implied in popular productions. In like
manner, they would chuse a friend or recommend a mistress for gross
defects; and tolerate the sweetness of an actress’s voice only for the
ugliness of her face. Pure pleasures are in their judgment cloying
and insipid—</p>

<p class='c015'>Nothing goes down with them but what is <em>caviare</em> to the multitude.

the rarity of the thing!</p>

<p class='c013'>The last sort I shall mention are <em>verbal critics</em>—mere word-catchers,
fellows that pick out a word in a sentence and a sentence in a volume,
and tell you it is wrong.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a> These erudite persons constantly find out
by anticipation that you are deficient in the smallest things—that you
cannot spell certain words or join the nominative case and the verb
together, because to do this is the height of their own ambition, and
of course they must set you down lower than their opinion of themselves.
They degrade by reducing you to their own standard of
merit; for the qualifications they deny you, or the faults they object
are so very insignificant, that to prove yourself possessed of the one
or free from the other, is to make yourself doubly ridiculous. Littleness
is their element, and they give a character of meanness to
whatever they touch. They creep, buzz, and fly-blow. It is much
easier to crush than to catch these troublesome insects; and when
they are in your power, your self-respect spares them. The race is
almost extinct:—one or two of them are sometimes seen crawling
over the pages of the Quarterly Review!</p>

<p class='c013'>The great and the little have, no doubt, a real existence in the
nature of things: but they both find pretty much the same level
in the mind of man. It is a common measure, which does not
always accommodate itself to the size and importance of the objects
it represents. It has a certain interest to spare for certain things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>(and no more) according to its humour and capacity; and neither
likes to be stinted in its allowance, nor to muster up an unusual share
of sympathy, just as the occasion may require. Perhaps if we
could recollect distinctly, we should discover that the two things
that have affected us most in the course of our lives have been, one
of them of the greatest, and the other of the smallest possible
consequence. To let that pass as too fine a speculation, we know
well enough that very trifling circumstances do give us great and
daily annoyance, and as often prove too much for our philosophy
and forbearance, as matters of the highest moment. A lump of
soot spoiling a man’s dinner, a plate of toast falling in the ashes,
the being disappointed of a ribbon to a cap or a ticket for a ball,
have led to serious and almost tragical consequences. Friends not
unfrequently fall out and never meet again for some idle misunderstanding,
‘some trick not worth an egg,’ who have stood the shock
of serious differences of opinion and clashing interests in life; and
there is an excellent paper in the <span class='sc'>Tatler</span>, to prove that if a married
couple do not quarrel about some point in the first instance not worth
contesting, they will seldom find an opportunity afterwards to quarrel
about a question of real importance. Grave divines, great statesmen,
and deep philosophers are put out of their way by very little things:
nay, discreet, worthy people, without any pretensions but to good-nature
and common sense, readily surrender the happiness of their
whole lives sooner than give up an opinion to which they have
committed themselves, though in all likelihood it was the mere turn
of a feather which side they should take in the argument. It is
the being baulked or thwarted in any thing that constitutes the
grievance, the unpardonable affront, not the value of the thing to
which we had made up our minds. Is it that we despise little
things; that we are not prepared for them; that they take us in
our careless, unguarded moments, and tease us out of our ordinary
patience by their petty, incessant, insect warfare, buzzing about us
and stinging us like gnats; so that we can neither get rid of nor
grapple with them, whereas we collect all our fortitude and resolution
to meet evils of greater magnitude? Or is it that there is a
certain stream of irritability that is continually fretting upon the
wheels of life, which finds sufficient food to play with in straws
and feathers, while great objects are too much for it, either choke
it up, or divert its course into serious and thoughtful interest?
Some attempt might be made to explain this in the following
manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>One is always more vexed at losing a game of any sort by a
single hole or ace, than if one has never had a chance of winning it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>This is no doubt in part or chiefly because the prospect of success
irritates the subsequent disappointment. But people have been
known to pine and fall sick from holding the next number to the
twenty thousand pound prize in the lottery. Now this could only
arise from their being so near winning in fancy, from there seeming
to be so thin a partition between them and success. When they
were within one of the right number, why could they not have
taken the next—it was so easy: this haunts their minds and will
not let them rest, notwithstanding the absurdity of the reasoning.
It is that the will here has a slight imaginary obstacle to surmount
to attain its end: it should appear it had only an exceedingly
trifling effort to make for this purpose, that it was absolutely in its
power (had it known) to seize the envied prize, and it is continually
harassing itself by making the obvious transition from one number
to the other, when it is too late. That is to say, the will acts in
proportion to its fancied power, to its superiority over immediate
obstacles. Now in little or indifferent matters there seems no
reason why it should not have its own way, and therefore a disappointment
vexes it the more. It grows angry according to the
insignificance of the occasion, and frets itself to death about an
object, merely because from its very futility there can be supposed
to be no real difficulty in the way of its attainment, nor any thing
more required for this purpose than a determination of the will.
The being baulked of this throws the mind off its balance, or puts
it into what is called <em>a passion</em>; and as nothing but an act of
voluntary power still seems necessary to get rid of every impediment,
we indulge our violence more and more, and heighten our impatience
by degrees into a sort of frenzy. The object is the same as it
was, but we are no longer as we were. The blood is heated, the
muscles are strained. The feelings are wound up to a pitch of
agony with the vain strife. The temper is tried to the utmost it
will bear. The more contemptible the object or the obstructions
in the way to it, the more are we provoked at being hindered by
them. It looks like witchcraft. We fancy there is a spell upon
us, so that we are hampered by straws and entangled in cobwebs.
We believe that there is a fatality about our affairs. It is evidently
done on purpose to plague us. A demon is at our elbow to torment
and defeat us in every thing, even in the smallest things. We see
him sitting and mocking us, and we rave and gnash our teeth at
him in return. It is particularly hard that we cannot succeed in
any one point, however trifling, that we set our hearts on. We
are the sport of imbecility and mischance. We make another
desperate effort, and fly out into all the extravagance of impotent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>rage once more. Our anger runs away with our reason, because,
as there is little to give it birth, there is nothing to check it or
recal us to our senses in the prospect of consequences. We take
up and rend in pieces the mere toys of humour, as the gusts of
wind take up and whirl about chaff and stubble. Passion plays the
tyrant, in a grand tragic-comic style, over the Lilliputian difficulties
and petty disappointments it has to encounter, gives way to all the
fretfulness of grief and all the turbulence of resentment, makes a
fuss about nothing because there is nothing to make a fuss about—when
an impending calamity, an irretrievable loss, would instantly
bring it to its recollection, and tame it in its preposterous career.
A man may be in a great passion and give himself strange airs at
so simple a thing as a game at ball, for instance; may rage like a
wild beast, and be ready to dash his head against the wall about
nothing, or about that which he will laugh at the next minute, and
think no more of ten minutes after, at the same time that a good
smart blow from the ball, the effects of which he might feel as a
serious inconvenience for a month, would calm him directly—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Anon as patient as the female dove,</div>
      <div class='line'>His silence will sit drooping.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The truth is, we pamper little griefs into great ones, and bear great
ones as well as we can. We can afford to dally and play tricks with
the one, but the others we have enough to do with, without any of
the wantonness and bombast of passion—without the swaggering of
Pistol, or the insolence of King Cambyses’ vein. To great evils we
submit, we resent little provocations. I have before now been disappointed
of a hundred pound job and lost half a crown at rackets on
the same day, and been more mortified at the latter than the former.
That which is lasting we share with the future, we defer the consideration
of till to-morrow: that which belongs to the moment we
drink up in all its bitterness, before the spirit evaporates. We probe
minute mischiefs to the quick; we lacerate, tear, and mangle our
bosoms with misfortune’s finest, brittlest point, and wreak our
vengeance on ourselves and it for good and all. Small pains are
more manageable, more within our reach; we can fret and worry
ourselves about them, can turn them into any shape, can twist and
torture them how we please:—a grain of sand in the eye, a thorn in
the flesh only irritates the part, and leaves us strength enough to
quarrel and get out of all patience with it:—a heavy blow stuns and
takes away all power of sense as well as of resistance. The great
and mighty reverses of fortune, like the revolutions of nature, may
be said to carry their own weight and reason along with them: they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>seem unavoidable and remediless, and we submit to them without
murmuring as to a fatal necessity. The magnitude of the events, in
which we may happen to be concerned, fills the mind, and carries it
out of itself, as it were, into the page of history. Our thoughts are
expanded with the scene on which we have to act, and lend us strength
to disregard our own personal share in it. Some men are indifferent
to the stroke of fate, as before and after earthquakes there is a calm
in the air. From the commanding situation whence they have been
accustomed to view things, they look down at themselves as only a
part of the whole, and can abstract their minds from the pressure of
misfortune, by the aid of its very violence. They are projected, in
the explosion of events, into a different sphere, far from their former
thoughts, purposes, and passions. The greatness of the change
anticipates the slow effects of time and reflection:—they at once
contemplate themselves from an immense distance, and look up with
speculative wonder at the height on which they stood. Had the
downfall been less complete, it would have been more galling and
borne with less resignation, because there might still be a chance of
remedying it by farther efforts and farther endurance—but <em>past cure,
past hope</em>. It is chiefly this cause (together with something of constitutional
character) which has enabled the greatest man in modern
history to bear his reverses of fortune with gay magnanimity, and to
submit to the loss of the empire of the world with as little discomposure
as if he had been playing a game at chess.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a> This does
not prove by our theory that he did not use to fly into violent passions
with Talleyrand for plaguing him with bad news when things went
wrong. He was mad at uncertain forebodings of disaster, but resigned
to its consummation. A man may dislike impertinence, yet
have no quarrel with necessity!</p>

<p class='c013'>There is another consideration that may take off our wonder at
the firmness with which the principals in great vicissitudes of fortune
bear their fate, which is, that they are in the secret of its operations,
and know that what to others appears chance-medley was unavoidable.
The clearness of their perception of all the circumstances converts
the uneasiness of doubt into certainty: they have not the qualms of
conscience which their admirers have, who cannot tell how much
of the event is to be attributed to the leaders, and how much to
unforeseen accidents: they are aware either that the result was not
to be helped, or that they did all they could to prevent it.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>It is the mist and obscurity through which we view objects that
makes us fancy they might have been, or might still be otherwise.
The precise knowledge of antecedents and consequents makes men
practical as well as philosophical Necessarians.—It is the want of this
knowledge which is the principle and soul of gambling, and of all
games of chance or partial skill. The supposition is, that the issue is
uncertain, and that there is no positive means of ascertaining it. It
is dependent on the turn of a die, on the tossing up of a halfpenny:
to be fair, it must be a lottery; there is no knowing but by the event;
and it is this which keeps the interest alive, and works up the passion
little short of madness. There is all the agitation of suspense, all the
alternation of hope and fear, of good and bad success, all the eagerness
of desire, without the possibility of reducing this to calculation, that
is, of subjecting the increased action of the will to a known rule, or
restraining the excesses of passion within the bounds of reason. We
see no cause beforehand why the run of the cards should not be in our
favour:—we will hear of none afterwards why it should not have been
so. As in the absence of all <em>data</em> to judge by, we wantonly fill up the
blank with the most extravagant expectations, so, when all is over, we
obstinately recur to the chance we had previously. There is nothing
to tame us down to the event, nothing to reconcile us to our hard
luck, for so we think it. We see no reason why we failed (and there
was none, any more than why we should succeed)—we think that,
reason apart, our will is the next best thing; we still try to have it
our own way, and fret, torment, and harrow ourselves up with vain
imaginations to effect impossibilities.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a> We play the game over again:
we wonder how it was possible for us to fail. We turn our brain
with straining at contradictions, and striving to make things what
they are not, or in other words, to subject the course of nature to our
fantastical wishes. ‘<em>If it had been so—if we had done such and such
a thing</em>’—we try it in a thousand different ways, and are just as far
off the mark as ever. We appealed to chance in the first instance,
and yet, when it has decided against us, we will not give in, and sit
down contented with our loss, but refuse to submit to any thing but
reason, which has nothing to do with the matter. In drawing two
straws, for example, to see which is the longest, there was no apparent
necessity we should fix upon the wrong one, it was so easy to have
fixed upon the other, nay, at one time we were going to do it—if we
had—the mind thus runs back to what was so possible and feasible at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>one time, while the thing was pending, and would fain give a bias
to causes so slender and insignificant, as the skittle-player bends his
body to give a bias to the bowl he has already delivered from his
hand, not considering that what is once determined, be the causes
ever so trivial or evanescent, is in the individual instance unalterable.
Indeed, to be a great philosopher, in the practical and most important
sense of the term, little more seems necessary than to be convinced
of the truth of the maxim, which the wise man repeated to the
daughter of King Cophetua, <em>That if a thing is, it is</em>, and there is an
end of it!</p>

<p class='c013'>We often make life unhappy in wishing things to have turned out
otherwise than they did, merely because that is possible to the
imagination which is impossible in fact. I remember when L—’s
farce was damned (for damned it was, that’s certain) I used to
dream every night for a month after (and then I vowed I would
plague myself no more about it) that it was revived at one of the
Minor or provincial theatres with great success, that such and such
retrenchments and alterations had been made in it, and that it was
thought <em>it might do at the other House</em>. I had heard indeed (this was
told in confidence to L—) that <em>Gentleman</em> Lewis was present on
the night of its performance, and said, that if he had had it, he would
have made it, by a few judicious curtailments, ‘the most popular
little thing that had been brought out for some time.’ How often
did I conjure up in recollection the full diapason of applause at the
end of the <em>Prologue</em>, and hear my ingenious friend in the first row of
the pit roar with laughter at his own wit! Then I dwelt with
forced complacency on some part in which it had been doing well:
then we would consider (in concert) whether the long, tedious opera
of the <cite>Travellers</cite>, which preceded it, had not tired people beforehand,
so that they had not spirits left for the quaint and sparkling ‘wit
skirmishes’ of the dialogue, and we all agreed it might have gone
down after a Tragedy, except L— himself, who swore he had no
hopes of it from the beginning, and that he knew the name of the
hero when it came to be discovered could not be got over.—Mr.
H—, thou wert damned! Bright shone the morning on the play-bills
that announced thy appearance, and the streets were filled with
the buzz of persons asking one another if they would go to see Mr.
H—, and answering that they would certainly: but before night
the gaiety, not of the author, but of his friends and the town was
eclipsed, for thou wert damned! Hadst thou been anonymous, thou
haply mightst have lived. But thou didst come to an untimely end
for thy tricks, and for want of a better name to pass them off!</p>

<p class='c013'>In this manner we go back to the critical minutes on which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>turn of our fate, or that of any one else in whom we are interested,
depended; try them over again with new knowledge and sharpened
sensibility; and thus think to alter what is irrevocable, and ease for
a moment the pang of lasting regret. So in a game at rackets<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a> (to
compare small things with great) I think if at such a point I had
followed up my success, if I had not been too secure or over-anxious
in another part, if I had played for such an opening, in short, if I had
done any thing but what I did and what has proved unfortunate in
the result, the chances were all in my favour. But it is merely
because I do not know what would have happened in the other case,
that I interpret it so readily to my own advantage. I have sometimes
lain awake a whole night, trying to serve out the last ball of
an interesting game in a particular corner of the court, which I had
missed from a nervous feeling. Rackets (I might observe for the
sake of the uninformed reader) is, like any other athletic game, very
much a thing of skill and practice: but it is also a thing of opinion,
‘subject to all the skyey influences.’ If you think you can win, you
can win. Faith is necessary to victory. If you hesitate in striking
at the ball, it is ten to one but you miss it. If you are apprehensive
of committing some particular error (such as striking the ball <em>foul</em>)
you will be nearly sure to do it. While thinking of that which you
are so earnestly bent upon avoiding, your hand mechanically follows
the strongest idea, and obeys the imagination rather than the intention
of the striker. A run of luck is a forerunner of success, and courage
is as much wanted as skill. No one is however free from nervous
sensations at times. A good player may not be able to strike a
single stroke if another comes into the court that he has a particular
dread of; and it frequently so happens that a player cannot beat
another even, though he can give half the game to an equal player,
because he has some associations of jealousy or personal pique against
the first which he has not towards the last. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed hæc hactenus.</span></i>
Chess is a game I do not understand, and have not comprehension
enough to play at. But I believe, though it is so much less a thing
of chance than science or skill, eager players pass whole nights in
marching and countermarching their men and check-mating a successful
adversary, supposing that at a certain point of the game, they had
determined upon making a particular move instead of the one which
they actually did make. I have heard a story of two persons playing
at back-gammon, one of whom was so enraged at losing his match at
a particular point of the game, that he took the board and threw it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>out of the window. It fell upon the head of one of the passengers
in the street, who came up to demand instant satisfaction for the
affront and injury he had sustained. The losing gamester only asked
him if he understood back-gammon, and finding that he did, said,
that if upon seeing the state of the game he did not excuse the
extravagance of his conduct, he would give him any other satisfaction
he wished for. The tables were accordingly brought, and the
situation of the two contending parties being explained, the gentleman
put up his sword, and went away perfectly satisfied.—To return from
this, which to some will seem a digression, and to others will serve
as a confirmation of the doctrine I am insisting on.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not then the value of the object, but the time and pains bestowed
upon it, that determines the sense and degree of our loss.
Many men set their minds only on trifles, and have not a compass of
soul to take an interest in any thing truly great and important beyond
forms and <em>minutiæ</em>. Such persons are really men of little minds, or

<p class='c015'>Larger objects elude their grasp, while they fasten eagerly on the
light and insignificant. They fidget themselves and others to death
with incessant anxiety about nothing. A part of their dress that is
awry keeps them in a fever of restlessness and impatience; they sit
picking their teeth, or paring their nails, or stirring the fire, or brushing
a speck of dirt off their coats, while the house or the world
tumbling about their ears would not rouse them from their morbid
insensibility. They cannot sit still on their chairs for their lives,
though, if there were any thing for them to do, they would become
immoveable. Their nerves are as irritable as their imaginations are
callous and inert. They are addicted to an inveterate habit of littleness
and perversity, which rejects every other motive to action or
object of contemplation but the daily, teazing, contemptible, familiar,
favourite sources of uneasiness and dissatisfaction. When they are
of a sanguine instead of a morbid temperament, they become
<em>quidnuncs</em> and virtuosos—collectors of caterpillars and odd volumes,
makers of fishing-rods and curious in watch-chains. Will Wimble
dabbled in this way, to his immortal honour. But many others have
been less successful. There are those who build their fame on
epigrams or epitaphs, and others who devote their lives to writing the
Lord’s Prayer in little. Some poets compose and sing their own
verses. Which character would they have us think most highly of—the
poet or the musician? The Great is One. Some there are who
feel more pride in sealing a letter with a head of Homer than ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>that old blind bard did in reciting his Iliad. These raise a huge
opinion of themselves out of nothing, as there are those who shrink
from their own merits into the shade of unconquerable humility. I
know one person at least, who would rather be the author of an unsuccessful
farce than of a successful tragedy. Repeated mortification
has produced an inverted ambition in his mind, and made failure the
bitter test of desert. He cannot lift his drooping head to gaze on the
gaudy crown of popularity placed within his reach, but casts a
pensive, rivetted look downwards to the modest flowers which the
multitude trample under their feet. If he had a piece likely to
succeed, coming out under all advantages, he would damn it by some
ill-timed, wilful jest, and lose the favour of the public, to preserve the
sense of his personal identity. ‘Misfortune,’ Shakespear says,
‘brings a man acquainted with strange bed-fellows:’ and it makes
our thoughts traitors to ourselves.—It is a maxim with many—‘<em>Take
care of the pence, and the pounds will take care of themselves.</em>’
Those only put it in practice successfully who think more of the
pence than of the pounds. To such, a large sum is less than a small
one. Great speculations, great returns are to them extravagant or
imaginary: a few hundreds a year are something <em>snug</em> and comfortable.
Persons who have been used to a petty, huckstering way of
life cannot enlarge their apprehensions to a notion of any thing better.
Instead of launching out into greater expense and liberality with the
tide of fortune, they draw back with a fear of consequences, and
think to succeed on a broader scale by dint of meanness and parsimony.
My uncle Toby frequently caught Trim standing up behind
his chair, when he had told him to be seated. What the corporal
did out of respect, others would do out of servility. The menial
character does not wear out in three or four generations. You cannot
keep some people out of the kitchen, merely because their grandfathers
or grandmothers came out of it. A poor man and his wife
walking along in the neighbourhood of Portland-place, he said to her
peevishly, ‘What is the use of walking along these fine streets and
squares? Let us turn down some alley!’ He felt he should be
more at home there. L— said of an old acquaintance of his,
that when he was young, he wanted to be a tailor, but had not spirit!
This is the misery of unequal matches. The woman cannot easily
forget, or think that others forget, her origin; and with perhaps
superior sense and beauty, keeps painfully in the back-ground. It is
worse when she braves this conscious feeling, and displays all the
insolence of the upstart and affected fine-lady. But shouldst thou
ever, my Infelice, grace my home with thy loved presence, as thou
hast cheered my hopes with thy smile, thou wilt conquer all hearts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>with thy prevailing gentleness, and I will shew the world what
Shakespear’s women were!—Some gallants set their hearts on
princesses; others descend in imagination to women of quality;
others are mad after opera-singers. For my part, I am shy even of
actresses, and should not think of leaving my card with Madame
V—. I am for none of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnes fortunes</span></i>; but for a list of
humble beauties, servant-maids and shepherd-girls, with their red
elbows, hard hands, black stockings and mob-caps, I could furnish out
a gallery equal to Cowley’s, and paint them half as well. Oh! might
I but attempt a description of some of them in poetic prose, Don
Juan would forget his Julia, and Mr. Davison might both print and
publish this volume. I agree so far with Horace, and differ with
Montaigne. I admire the Clementinas and Clarissas at a distance:
the Pamelas and Fannys of Richardson and Fielding make my blood
tingle. I have written love-letters to such in my time, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d’un
pathétique à faire fendre les rochers</span></i>, and with about as much effect as
if they had been addressed to stone. The simpletons only laughed,
and said, that ‘those were not the sort of things to gain the affections.’
I wish I had kept copies in my own justification.
What is worse, I have an utter aversion to <em>blue-stockings</em>. I do not
care a fig for any woman that knows even what <em>an author</em> means.
If I know that she has read any thing I have written, I cut her
acquaintance immediately. This sort of literary intercourse with
me passes for nothing. Her critical and scientific acquirements are
<em>carrying coals to Newcastle</em>. I do not want to be told that I have
published such or such a work. I knew all this before. It makes
no addition to my sense of power. I do not wish the affair to
be brought about in that way. I would have her read my soul:
she should understand the language of the heart: she should
know what I am, as if she were another self! She should
love me for myself alone. I like myself without any reason:—I
would have her do so too. This is not very reasonable. I abstract
from my temptations to admire all the circumstances of dress, birth,
breeding, fortune; and I would not willingly put forward my own
pretensions, whatever they may be. The image of some fair creature
is engraven on my inmost soul; it is on that I build my claim to her
regard, and expect her to see into my heart, as I see her form always
before me. Wherever she treads, pale primroses, like her face,
vernal hyacinths, like her brow, spring up beneath her feet, and
music hangs on every bough: but all is cold, barren, and desolate
without her. Thus I feel and thus I think. But have I ever told
her so? No. Or if I did, would she understand it? No. I
‘hunt the wind, I worship a statue, cry aloud to the desert.’ To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>see beauty is not to be beautiful, to pine in love is not to be loved
again.—I always was inclined to raise and magnify the power of
Love. I thought that his sweet power should only be exerted to
join together the loveliest forms and fondest hearts; that none but
those in whom his Godhead shone outwardly, and was inly felt,
should ever partake of his triumphs; and I stood and gazed at a
distance, as unworthy to mingle in so bright a throng, and did not
(even for a moment) wish to tarnish the glory of so fair a vision by
being myself admitted into it. I say this was my notion once, but
God knows it was one of the errors of my youth. For coming
nearer to look, I saw the maimed, the blind, and the halt enter in,
the crooked and the dwarf, the ugly, the old and impotent, the man
of pleasure and the man of the world, the dapper and the pert, the
vain and shallow boaster, the fool and the pedant, the ignorant and
brutal, and all that is farthest removed from earth’s fairest-born, and
the pride of human life. Seeing all these enter the courts of Love,
and thinking that I also might venture in under favour of the crowd,
but finding myself rejected, I fancied (I might be wrong) that it
was not so much because I was below, as above the common standard.
I did feel, but I was ashamed to feel, mortified at my repulse, when
I saw the meanest of mankind, the very scum and refuse, all creeping
things and every obscene creature, enter in before me. I seemed a
species by myself. I took a pride even in my disgrace: and concluded
I had elsewhere my inheritance! The only thing I ever
piqued myself upon was the writing the <cite>Essay on the Principles of
Human Action</cite>—a work that no woman ever read, or would ever
comprehend the meaning of. But if I do not build my claim to
regard on the pretensions I have, how can I build it on those I am
totally without? Or why do I complain and expect to gather grapes
of thorns, or figs of thistles? Thought has in me cancelled pleasure;
and this dark forehead, bent upon truth, is the rock on which all
affection has split. And thus I waste my life in one long sigh;
nor ever (till too late) beheld a gentle face turned gently upon mine!...
But no! not too late, if that face, pure, modest, downcast,
tender, with angel sweetness, not only gladdens the prospect of the
future, but sheds its radiance on the past, smiling in tears. A purple
light hovers round my head. The air of love is in the room. As I
look at my long-neglected copy of the Death of Clorinda, golden
gleams play upon the canvas, as they used when I painted it. The
flowers of Hope and Joy springing up in my mind, recal the time
when they first bloomed there. The years that are fled knock at
the door and enter. I am in the Louvre once more. The sun of
Austerlitz has not set. It still shines here—in my heart; and he,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the son of glory, is not dead, nor ever shall, to me. I am as when
my life began. The rainbow is in the sky again. I see the skirts
of the departed years. All that I have thought and felt has not been
in vain. I am not utterly worthless, unregarded; nor shall I die
and wither of pure scorn. Now could I sit on the tomb of Liberty,
and write a Hymn to Love. Oh! if I am deceived, let me be
deceived still. Let me live in the Elysium of those soft looks;
poison me with kisses, kill me with smiles; but still mock me with
thy love!<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Poets chuse mistresses who have the fewest charms, that they
may make something out of nothing. They succeed best in fiction,
and they apply this rule to love. They make a Goddess of any
dowdy. As Don Quixote said, in answer to the matter of fact
remonstrances of Sancho, that Dulcinea del Toboso answered the
purpose of signalising his valour just as well as the ‘fairest princess
under sky,’ so any of the fair sex will serve them to write about just
as well as another. They take some awkward thing and dress her
up in fine words, as children dress up a wooden doll in fine clothes.
Perhaps, a fine head of hair, a taper waist, or some other circumstance
strikes them, and they make the rest out according to their fancies.
They have a wonderful knack of supplying deficiencies in the subjects
of their idolatry out of the store-house of their imaginations. They
presently translate their favourites to the skies, where they figure
with Berenice’s locks and Ariadne’s crown. This predilection for
the unprepossessing and insignificant, I take to arise not merely from
a desire in poets to have some subject to exercise their inventive
talents upon, but from their jealousy of any pretensions (even those
of beauty in the other sex) that might interfere with the continual
incense offered to their personal vanity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cardinal Mazarine never thought any thing of Cardinal de Retz,
after he told him that he had written for the last thirty years of his
life with the same pen. Some Italian poet going to present a copy
of verses to the Pope, and finding, as he was looking them over in
the coach as he went, a mistake of a single letter in the printing,
broke his heart of vexation and chagrin. A still more remarkable
case of literary disappointment occurs in the history of a countryman
of his, which I cannot refrain from giving here, as I find it related.
‘Anthony Codrus Urceus, a most learned and unfortunate Italian,
born near Modena, 1446, was a striking instance,’ says his biographer,
‘of the miseries men bring upon themselves by setting their affections
unreasonably on trifles. This learned man lived at Forli, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>an apartment in the palace. His room was so very dark, that he
was forced to use a candle in the day-time; and one day, going
abroad without putting it out, his library was set on fire, and some
papers which he had prepared for the press were burned. The
instant he was informed of this ill news, he was affected even to
madness. He ran furiously to the palace, and stopping at the door
of his apartment, he cried aloud, “Christ Jesus! what mighty crime
have I committed! whom of your followers have I ever injured, that
you thus rage with inexpiable hatred against me?” Then turning
himself to an image of the Virgin Mary near at hand, “Virgin (says
he) hear what I have to say, for I speak in earnest, and with a composed
spirit: if I shall happen to address you in my dying moments, I humbly
intreat you not to hear me, nor receive me into Heaven, for I am determined
to spend all eternity in Hell!” Those who heard these
blasphemous expressions endeavoured to comfort him; but all to no
purpose: for, the society of mankind being no longer supportable to
him, he left the city, and retired, like a savage, to the deep solitude of
a wood. Some say that he was murdered there by ruffians: others,
that he died at Bologna in 1500, after much contrition and penitence.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps the censure passed at the outset of the anecdote on this
unfortunate person is unfounded and severe, when it is said that he
brought his miseries on himself ‘by having set his affections unreasonably
on trifles.’ To others it might appear so: but to himself
the labour of a whole life was hardly a trifle. His passion was not
a causeless one, though carried to such frantic excess. The story of
Sir Isaac Newton presents a strong contrast to the last-mentioned
one, who on going into his study and finding that his dog Tray had
thrown down a candle on the table, and burnt some papers of great
value, contented himself with exclaiming, ‘Ah! Tray, you don’t
know the mischief you have done!’ Many persons would not
forgive the overturning of a cup of chocolate so soon.</p>

<p class='c013'>I remember hearing an instance some years ago of a man of
character and property, who through unexpected losses had been
condemned to a long and heart-breaking imprisonment, which he
bore with exemplary fortitude. At the end of four years, by the
interest and exertions of friends, he obtained his discharge with
every prospect of beginning the world afresh, and had made his
arrangements for leaving his irksome abode, and meeting his wife
and family at a distance of two hundred miles by a certain day.
Owing to the miscarriage of a letter, some signature necessary to the
completion of the business did not arrive in time, and on account of the
informality which had thus arisen, he could not set out home till the
return of the post, which was four days longer. His spirit could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>brook the delay. He had wound himself up to the last pitch of
expectation; he had, as it were, calculated his patience to hold out to
a certain point, and then to throw down his load for ever, and he
could not find resolution to resume it for a few hours beyond this.
He put an end to the intolerable conflict of hope and disappointment
in a fit of excruciating anguish. Woes that we have time to foresee
and leisure to contemplate break their force by being spread over a
larger surface, and borne at intervals; but those that come upon us
suddenly, for however short a time, seem to insult us by their unnecessary
and uncalled-for intrusion; and the very prospect of relief,
when held out and then withdrawn from us, to however small a distance,
only frets impatience into agony by tantalising our hopes and wishes;
and to rend asunder the thin partition that separates us from our
favourite object, we are ready to burst even the fetters of life itself!</p>

<p class='c013'>I am not aware that any one has demonstrated how it is that a
stronger capacity is required for the conduct of great affairs than of
small ones. The organs of the mind, like the pupil of the eye, may
be contracted or dilated to view a broader or a narrower surface, and
yet find sufficient variety to occupy its attention in each. The
material universe is infinitely divisible, and so is the texture of human
affairs. We take things in the gross or in the detail, according to
the occasion. I think I could as soon get up the budget of Ways
and Means for the current year, as be sure of making both ends meet,
and paying my rent at quarter-day in a paltry huckster’s shop.
Great objects move on by their own weight and impulse: great
power turns aside petty obstacles; and he, who wields it, is often but
the puppet of circumstances, like the fly on the wheel that said,
‘What a dust we raise!’ It is easier to ruin a kingdom and aggrandise
one’s own pride and prejudices than to set up a green-grocer’s
stall. An idiot or a madman may do this at any time, whose word
is law, and whose nod is fate. Nay, he whose look is obedience, and
who understands the silent wishes of the great, may easily trample
on the necks and tread out the liberties of a mighty nation, deriding
their strength, and hating it the more from a consciousness of his own
meanness. Power is not wisdom, it is true; but it equally ensures
its own objects. It does not exact, but dispenses with talent. When
a man creates this power, or new-moulds the state by sage counsels
and bold enterprises, it is a different thing from overturning it with
the levers that are put into his baby hands. In general, however, it
may be argued that great transactions and complicated concerns ask
more genius to conduct them than smaller ones, for this reason, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>
that the mind must be able either to embrace a greater variety of
details in a more extensive range of objects, or must have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>greater faculty of generalising, or a greater depth of insight into
ruling principles, and so come at true results in that way. Buonaparte
knew everything, even to the names of our cadets in the East-India
service; but he failed in this, that he did not calculate the resistance
which barbarism makes to refinement. He thought that the Russians
could not burn Moscow, because the Parisians could not burn Paris.
The French think every thing must be French. The Cossacks, alas!
do not conform to etiquette: the rudeness of the seasons knows no
rules of politeness!—Some artists think it a test of genius to paint a
large picture, and I grant the truth of this position, if the large
picture contains more than a small one. It is not the size of the
canvas, but the quantity of truth and nature put into it, that settles
the point. It is a mistake, common enough on this subject, to
suppose that a miniature is more finished than an oil-picture. The
miniature is inferior to the oil-picture only because it is less finished,
because it cannot follow nature into so many individual and exact particulars.
The proof of which is, that the copy of a good portrait will
always make a highly finished miniature (see for example Mr. Bone’s
enamels), whereas the copy of a good miniature, if enlarged to the
size of life, will make but a very sorry portrait. Several of our best
artists, who are fond of painting large figures, invert this reasoning.
They make the whole figure gigantic, not that they may have room
for nature, but for the motion of their brush (as if they were painting
the side of a house), regarding the extent of canvas they have to
cover as an excuse for their slovenly and hasty manner of getting over
it; and thus, in fact, leave their pictures nothing at last but overgrown
miniatures, but huge caricatures. It is not necessary in any
case (either in a larger or a smaller compass) to go into details, so as
to lose sight of the effect, and decompound the face into porous and
transparent molecules, in the manner of Denner, who painted what
he saw through a magnifying glass. The painter’s eye need not be a
microscope, but I contend that it should be a looking-glass, bright,
clear, lucid. The <em>little</em> in art begins with insignificant parts, with
what does not tell in connection with other parts. The true artist
will paint not material points, but <em>moral quantities</em>. In a word, wherever
there is feeling or expression in a muscle or a vein, there is grandeur
and refinement too.—I will conclude these remarks with an account
of the manner in which the ancient sculptors combined great and little
things in such matters. ‘That the name of Phidias,’ says Pliny, ‘is
illustrious among all the nations that have heard of the fame of the
Olympian Jupiter, no one doubts; but in order that those may know
that he is deservedly praised who have not even seen his works, we
shall offer a few arguments, and those of his genius only: nor to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>purpose shall we insist on the beauty of the Olympian Jupiter, nor
on the magnitude of the Minerva at Athens, though it is twenty-six
cubits in height (about thirty-five feet), and is made of ivory and
gold: but we shall refer to the shield, on which the battle of the
Amazons is carved on the outer side: on the inside of the same is
the fight of the Gods and Giants; and on the sandals, that between
the Centaurs and Lapithæ; so well did every part of that work display
the powers of the art. Again, the sculptures on the pedestal he
called the birth of Pandora: there are to be seen in number thirty Gods,
the figure of Victory being particularly admirable: the learned also
admire the figures of the serpent and the brazen sphinx, writhing under
the spear. These things are mentioned, in passing, of an artist never
enough to be commended, that it may be seen that he shewed the same
magnificence even in small things.’—<cite>Pliny’s Natural History</cite>, Book 36.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XXIV<br /> <span class='small'>ON FAMILIAR STYLE</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>It is not easy to write a familiar style. Many people mistake a
familiar for a vulgar style, and suppose that to write without affectation
is to write at random. On the contrary, there is nothing that
requires more precision, and, if I may so say, purity of expression,
than the style I am speaking of. It utterly rejects not only all
unmeaning pomp, but all low, cant phrases, and loose, unconnected,
<em>slipshod</em> allusions. It is not to take the first word that offers, but the
best word in common use; it is not to throw words together in any
combinations we please, but to follow and avail ourselves of the true
idiom of the language. To write a genuine familiar or truly English
style, is to write as any one would speak in common conversation,
who had a thorough command and choice of words, or who could
discourse with ease, force, and perspicuity, setting aside all pedantic
and oratorical flourishes. Or to give another illustration, to write
naturally is the same thing in regard to common conversation, as to read
naturally is in regard to common speech. It does not follow that it
is an easy thing to give the true accent and inflection to the words
you utter, because you do not attempt to rise above the level of
ordinary life and colloquial speaking. You do not assume indeed the
solemnity of the pulpit, or the tone of stage-declamation: neither are
you at liberty to gabble on at a venture, without emphasis or discretion,
or to resort to vulgar dialect or clownish pronunciation. You
must steer a middle course. You are tied down to a given and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>appropriate articulation, which is determined by the habitual associations
between sense and sound, and which you can only hit by
entering into the author’s meaning, as you must find the proper
words and style to express yourself by fixing your thoughts on the
subject you have to write about. Any one may mouth out a passage
with a theatrical cadence, or get upon stilts to tell his thoughts: but
to write or speak with propriety and simplicity is a more difficult
task. Thus it is easy to affect a pompous style, to use a word twice
as big as the thing you want to express: it is not so easy to pitch
upon the very word that exactly fits it. Out of eight or ten words
equally common, equally intelligible, with nearly equal pretensions, it
is a matter of some nicety and discrimination to pick out the very
one, the preferableness of which is scarcely perceptible, but decisive.
The reason why I object to Dr. Johnson’s style is, that there is no
discrimination, no selection, no variety in it. He uses none but ‘tall,
opaque words,’ taken from the ‘first row of the rubric:’—words
with the greatest number of syllables, or Latin phrases with merely
English terminations. If a fine style depended on this sort of
arbitrary pretension, it would be fair to judge of an author’s elegance
by the measurement of his words, and the substitution of foreign
circumlocutions (with no precise associations) for the mother-tongue.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
How simple it is to be dignified without ease, to be pompous without
meaning! Surely, it is but a mechanical rule for avoiding what is
low to be always pedantic and affected. It is clear you cannot use a
vulgar English word, if you never use a common English word at
all. A fine tact is shewn in adhering to those which are perfectly
common, and yet never falling into any expressions which are debased
by disgusting circumstances, or which owe their signification and
point to technical or professional allusions. A truly natural or
familiar style can never be quaint or vulgar, for this reason, that
it is of universal force and applicability, and that quaintness and
vulgarity arise out of the immediate connection of certain words with
coarse and disagreeable, or with confined ideas. The last form what
we understand by <em>cant</em> or <em>slang</em> phrases.—To give an example of
what is not very clear in the general statement. I should say that
the phrase <em>To cut with a knife</em>, or <em>To cut a piece of wood</em>, is perfectly
free from vulgarity, because it is perfectly common: but to <em>cut an
acquaintance</em> is not quite unexceptionable, because it is not perfectly
common or intelligible, and has hardly yet escaped out of the limits
of slang phraseology. I should hardly therefore use the word in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>this sense without putting it in italics as a license of expression, to
be received <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum grano salis</span></i>. All provincial or bye-phrases come
under the same mark of reprobation—all such as the writer transfers
to the page from his fire-side or a particular <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coterie</span></i>, or that he invents
for his own sole use and convenience. I conceive that words are
like money, not the worse for being common, but that it is the stamp
of custom alone that gives them circulation or value. I am fastidious
in this respect, and would almost as soon coin the currency of the
realm as counterfeit the King’s English. I never invented or gave
a new and unauthorised meaning to any word but one single one
(the term <em>impersonal</em> applied to feelings) and that was in an abstruse
metaphysical discussion to express a very difficult distinction. I
have been (I know) loudly accused of revelling in vulgarisms and
broken English. I cannot speak to that point: but so far I plead
guilty to the determined use of acknowledged idioms and common
elliptical expressions. I am not sure that the critics in question
know the one from the other, that is, can distinguish any medium
between formal pedantry and the most barbarous solecism. As an
author, I endeavour to employ plain words and popular modes of construction,
as were I a chapman and dealer, I should common weights
and measures.</p>

<p class='c013'>The proper force of words lies not in the words themselves, but
in their application. A word may be a fine-sounding word, of an
unusual length, and very imposing from its learning and novelty, and
yet in the connection in which it is introduced, may be quite pointless
and irrelevant. It is not pomp or pretension, but the adaptation of
the expression to the idea that clenches a writer’s meaning:—as it is
not the size or glossiness of the materials, but their being fitted each
to its place, that gives strength to the arch; or as the pegs and nails
are as necessary to the support of the building as the larger timbers,
and more so than the mere shewy, unsubstantial ornaments. I hate
any thing that occupies more space that it is worth. I hate to see a
load of band-boxes go along the street, and I hate to see a parcel
of big words without any thing in them. A person who does not
deliberately dispose of all his thoughts alike in cumbrous draperies
and flimsy disguises, may strike out twenty varieties of familiar every-day
language, each coming somewhat nearer to the feeling he wants
to convey, and at last not hit upon that particular and only one,
which may be said to be identical with the exact impression in his
mind. This would seem to shew that Mr. Cobbett is hardly right
in saying that the first word that occurs is always the best. It may
be a very good one; and yet a better may present itself on reflection
or from time to time. It should be suggested naturally, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>and spontaneously, from a fresh and lively conception of the subject.
We seldom succeed by trying at improvement, or by merely substituting
one word for another that we are not satisfied with, as we cannot
recollect the name of a place or person by merely plaguing ourselves
about it. We wander farther from the point by persisting in a wrong
scent; but it starts up accidentally in the memory when we least expected
it, by touching some link in the chain of previous association.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are those who hoard up and make a cautious display of
nothing but rich and rare phraseology;—ancient medals, obscure
coins, and Spanish pieces of eight. They are very curious to
inspect; but I myself would neither offer nor take them in the course
of exchange. A sprinkling of archaisms is not amiss; but a tissue of
obsolete expressions is more fit <em>for keep than wear</em>. I do not say I
would not use any phrase that had been brought into fashion before
the middle or the end of the last century; but I should be shy of using
any that had not been employed by any approved author during the
whole of that time. Words, like clothes, get old-fashioned, or mean
and ridiculous, when they have been for some time laid aside. Mr.
Lamb is the only imitator of old English style I can read with
pleasure; and he is so thoroughly imbued with the spirit of his
authors, that the idea of imitation is almost done away. There is an
inward unction, a marrowy vein both in the thought and feeling, an
intuition, deep and lively, of his subject, that carries off any quaintness
or awkwardness arising from an antiquated style and dress.
The matter is completely his own, though the manner is assumed.
Perhaps his ideas are altogether so marked and individual, as to
require their point and pungency to be neutralised by the affectation
of a singular but traditional form of conveyance. Tricked out in the
prevailing costume, they would probably seem more startling and out
of the way. The old English authors, Burton, Fuller, Coryate, Sir
Thomas Brown, are a kind of mediators between us and the more
eccentric and whimsical modern, reconciling us to his peculiarities.
I do not however know how far this is the case or not, till he condescends
to write like one of us. I must confess that what I like
best of his papers under the signature of Elia (still I do not presume,
amidst such excellence, to decide what is most excellent) is the
account of <cite>Mrs. Battle’s Opinions on Whist</cite>, which is also the most
free from obsolete allusions and turns of expression—</p>

<p class='c015'>To those acquainted with his admired prototypes, these Essays of the
ingenious and highly gifted author have the same sort of charm and
relish, that Erasmus’s Colloquies or a fine piece of modern Latin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>have to the classical scholar. Certainly, I do not know any borrowed
pencil that has more power or felicity of execution than the one of
which I have here been speaking.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is as easy to write a gaudy style without ideas, as it is to spread
a pallet of shewy colours, or to smear in a flaunting transparency.
‘What do you read?’—‘Words, words, words.’—‘What is the
matter?’—‘<em>Nothing</em>,’ it might be answered. The florid style is the
reverse of the familiar. The last is employed as an unvarnished
medium to convey ideas; the first is resorted to as a spangled veil to
conceal the want of them. When there is nothing to be set down
but words, it costs little to have them fine. Look through the
dictionary, and cull out a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">florilegium</span></i>, rival the <em>tulippomania</em>. <em>Rouge</em>
high enough, and never mind the natural complexion. The vulgar,
who are not in the secret, will admire the look of preternatural health
and vigour; and the fashionable, who regard only appearances, will
be delighted with the imposition. Keep to your sounding generalities,
your tinkling phrases, and all will be well. Swell out an unmeaning
truism to a perfect tympany of style. A thought, a distinction is the
rock on which all this brittle cargo of verbiage splits at once. Such
writers have merely <em>verbal</em> imaginations, that retain nothing but words.
Or their puny thoughts have dragon-wings, all green and gold.
They soar far above the vulgar failing of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sermo humi obrepens</span></i>—their
most ordinary speech is never short of an hyperbole, splendid,
imposing, vague, incomprehensible, magniloquent, a cento of sounding
common-places. If some of us, whose ‘ambition is more lowly,’ pry
a little too narrowly into nooks and corners to pick up a number of
‘unconsidered trifles,’ they never once direct their eyes or lift their
hands to seize on any but the most gorgeous, tarnished, thread-bare
patch-work set of phrases, the left-off finery of poetic extravagance,
transmitted down through successive generations of barren pretenders.
If they criticise actors and actresses, a huddled phantasmagoria of
feathers, spangles, floods of light, and oceans of sound float before
their morbid sense, which they paint in the style of Ancient Pistol.
Not a glimpse can you get of the merits or defects of the performers:
they are hidden in a profusion of barbarous epithets and wilful
rhodomontade. Our hypercritics are not thinking of these little
fantoccini beings—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>If they describe kings and queens, it is an Eastern pageant. The
Coronation at either House is nothing to it. We get at four repeated
images—a curtain, a throne, a sceptre, and a foot-stool. These are
with them the wardrobe of a lofty imagination; and they turn their
servile strains to servile uses. Do we read a description of pictures?
It is not a reflection of tones and hues which ‘nature’s own sweet
and cunning hand laid on,’ but piles of precious stones, rubies, pearls,
emeralds, Golconda’s mines, and all the blazonry of art. Such
persons are in fact besotted with words, and their brains are turned
with the glittering, but empty and sterile phantoms of things.
Personifications, capital letters, seas of sunbeams, visions of glory,
shining inscriptions, the figures of a transparency, Britannia with her
shield, or Hope leaning on an anchor, make up their stock in trade.
They may be considered as <em>hieroglyphical</em> writers. Images stand out
in their minds isolated and important merely in themselves, without
any ground-work of feeling—there is no context in their imaginations.
Words affect them in the same way, by the mere sound, that is, by
their possible, not by their actual application to the subject in hand.
They are fascinated by first appearances, and have no sense of
consequences. Nothing more is meant by them than meets the ear:
they understand or feel nothing more than meets their eye. The
web and texture of the universe, and of the heart of man, is a mystery
to them: they have no faculty that strikes a chord in unison with it.
They cannot get beyond the daubings of fancy, the varnish of
sentiment. Objects are not linked to feelings, words to things, but
images revolve in splendid mockery, words represent themselves in
their strange rhapsodies. The categories of such a mind are pride
and ignorance—pride in outside show, to which they sacrifice every
thing, and ignorance of the true worth and hidden structure both of
words and things. With a sovereign contempt for what is familiar
and natural, they are the slaves of vulgar affectation—of a routine of
high-flown phrases. Scorning to imitate realities, they are unable to
invent any thing, to strike out one original idea. They are not
copyists of nature, it is true: but they are the poorest of all plagiarists,
the plagiarists of words. All is far-fetched, dear-bought, artificial,
oriental in subject and allusion: all is mechanical, conventional,
vapid, formal, pedantic in style and execution. They startle and
confound the understanding of the reader, by the remoteness and
obscurity of their illustrations: they soothe the ear by the monotony
of the same everlasting round of circuitous metaphors. They are the
<em>mock-school</em> in poetry and prose. They flounder about between
fustian in expression, and bathos in sentiment. They tantalise the
fancy, but never reach the head nor touch the heart. Their Temple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>of Fame is like a shadowy structure raised by Dulness to Vanity, or
like Cowper’s description of the Empress of Russia’s palace of ice,

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XXV<br /> <span class='small'>ON EFFEMINACY OF CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>Effeminacy of character arises from a prevalence of the sensibility
over the will: or it consists in a want of fortitude to bear pain or to
undergo fatigue, however urgent the occasion. We meet with
instances of people who cannot lift up a little finger to save themselves
from ruin, nor give up the smallest indulgence for the sake of any
other person. They cannot put themselves out of their way on any
account. No one makes a greater outcry when the day of reckoning
comes, or affects greater compassion for the mischiefs they have
occasioned; but till the time comes, they feel nothing, they care for
nothing. They live in the present moment, are the creatures of the
present impulse (whatever it may be)—and beyond that, the universe
is nothing to them. The slightest toy countervails the empire of the
world; they will not forego the smallest inclination they feel, for
any object that can be proposed to them, or any reasons that can be
urged for it. You might as well ask of the gossamer not to wanton
in the idle summer air, or of the moth not to play with the flame
that scorches it, as ask of these persons to put off any enjoyment for
a single instant, or to gird themselves up to any enterprise of pith or
moment. They have been so used to a studied succession of
agreeable sensations, that the shortest pause is a privation which they
can by no means endure—it is like tearing them from their very
existence—they have been so inured to ease and indolence, that the
most trifling effort is like one of the tasks of Hercules, a thing of
impossibility, at which they shudder. They lie on beds of roses,
and spread their gauze wings to the sun and summer gale, and cannot
bear to put their tender feet to the ground, much less to encounter
the thorns and briers of the world. Life for them</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—‘rolls o’er Elysian flowers its amber stream’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and they have no fancy for fishing in troubled waters. The ordinary
state of existence they regard as something importunate and vain, and
out of nature. What must they think of its trials and sharp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>vicissitudes? Instead of voluntarily embracing pain, or labour, or
danger, or death, every sensation must be wound up to the highest
pitch of voluptuous refinement, every motion must be grace and
elegance; they live in a luxurious, endless dream, or</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Die of a rose in aromatic pain!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Siren sounds must float around them; smiling forms must every
where meet their sight; they must tread a soft measure on painted
carpets or smooth-shaven lawns; books, arts, jests, laughter, occupy
every thought and hour—what have they to do with the drudgery,
the struggles, the poverty, the disease or anguish, which are the
common lot of humanity! These things are intolerable to them,
even in imagination. They disturb the enchantment in which they
are lapt. They cause a wrinkle in the clear and polished surface of
their existence. They exclaim with impatience and in agony, ‘Oh,
leave me to my repose!’ How ‘they shall discourse the freezing
hours away, when wind and rain beat dark December down,’ or
‘bide the pelting of the pitiless storm,’ gives them no concern, it
never once enters their heads. They close the shutters, draw the
curtains, and enjoy or shut out the whistling of the approaching
tempest. ‘They take no thought for the morrow,’ not they. They
do not anticipate evils. Let them come when they will come, they
will not run to meet them. Nay more, they will not move one step
to prevent them, nor let any one else. The mention of such things
is shocking; the very supposition is a nuisance that must not be
tolerated. The idea of the trouble, the precautions, the negotiations
necessary to obviate disagreeable consequences oppresses them to
death, is an exertion too great for their enervated imaginations.
They are not like Master Barnardine in Measure for Measure, who
would not ‘get up to be hanged’—they would not get up to avoid
being hanged. They are completely wrapped up in themselves; but
then all their self-love is concentrated in the present minute. They
have worked up their effeminate and fastidious appetite of enjoyment
to such a pitch, that the whole of their existence, every moment of it,
must be made up of these exquisite indulgences; or they will fling it
all away, with indifference and scorn. They stake their entire
welfare on the gratification of the passing instant. Their senses, their
vanity, their thoughtless gaiety have been pampered till they ache at
the smallest suspension of their perpetual dose of excitement, and
they will purchase the hollow happiness of the next five minutes, by a
mortgage on the independence and comfort of years. They must
have their will in every thing, or they grow sullen and peevish like
spoiled children. Whatever they set their eyes on, or make up their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>minds to, they must have that instant. They may pay for it hereafter.
But that is no matter. They snatch a joy beyond the reach of fate,
and consider the present time sacred, inviolable, unaccountable to that
hard, churlish, niggard, inexorable task-master, the future. Now or
never is their motto. They are madly devoted to the play-thing, the
ruling passion of the moment. What is to happen to them a week
hence is as if it were to happen to them a thousand years hence. They
put off the consideration for another day, and their heedless unconcern
laughs at it as a fable. Their life is ‘a cell of ignorance, travelling
a-bed;’ their existence is ephemeral; their thoughts are insect-winged,
their identity expires with the whim, the folly, the passion of the hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing but a miracle can rouse such people from their lethargy.
It is not to be expected, nor is it even possible in the natural course
of things. Pope’s striking exclamation,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>hardly applies here; namely, to evils that stare us in the face, and
that might be averted with the least prudence or resolution. But
nothing can be done. How should it? A slight evil, a distant
danger will not move them; and a more imminent one only makes
them turn away from it in greater precipitation and alarm. The
more desperate their affairs grow, the more averse they are to look
into them; and the greater the effort required to retrieve them, the
more incapable they are of it. At first, they will not do any thing;
and afterwards, it is too late. The very motives that imperiously
urge them to self-reflection and amendment, combine with their
natural disposition to prevent it. This amounts pretty nearly to a
mathematical demonstration. Ease, vanity, pleasure, are the ruling
passions in such cases. How will you conquer these, or wean their
infatuated votaries from them? By the dread of hardship, disgrace,
pain? They turn from them and you who point them out as the
alternative, with sickly disgust; and instead of a stronger effort of
courage or self-denial to avert the crisis, hasten it by a wilful determination
to pamper the disease in every way, and arm themselves,
not with fortitude to bear or to repel the consequences, but with
judicial blindness to their approach. Will you rouse the indolent
procrastinator to an irksome but necessary effort, by shewing him how
much he has to do? He will only draw back the more for all
your intreaties and representations. If of a sanguine turn, he will
make a slight attempt at a new plan of life, be satisfied with the first
appearance of reform, and relapse into indolence again. If timid
and undecided, the hopelessness of the undertaking will put him out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>of heart with it, and he will stand still in despair. Will you save a vain
man from ruin, by pointing out the obloquy and ridicule that await
him in his present career? He smiles at your forebodings as
fantastical; or the more they are realised around him, the more
he is impelled to keep out the galling conviction, and the more fondly
he clings to flattery and death. He will not make a bold and
resolute attempt to recover his reputation, because that would imply
that it was capable of being soiled or injured; or he no sooner
meditates some desultory project, than he takes credit to himself for
the execution, and is delighted to wear his unearned laurels while the
thing is barely talked of. The chance of success relieves the uneasiness<a id='t251'></a>
of his apprehensions; so that he makes use of the interval only to
flatter his favourite infirmity again. Would you wean a man from
sensual excesses by the inevitable consequences to which they lead?—What
holds more antipathy to pleasure than pain? The mind given
up to self-indulgence, revolts at suffering; and throws it from it as an
unaccountable anomaly, as a piece of injustice when it comes. Much
less will it acknowledge any affinity with or subjection to it as a mere
threat. If the prediction does not immediately come true, we laugh
at the prophet of ill: if it is verified, we hate our adviser proportionably,
hug our vices the closer, and hold them dearer and more
precious, the more they cost us. We resent wholesome counsel as
an impertinence, and consider those who warn us of impending
mischief, as if they had brought it on our heads. We cry out with
the poetical enthusiast—</p>

      <div class='line'>Though grief and pain should come to-morrow?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>But oh thou! who didst lend me speech when I was dumb, to whom
I owe it that I have not crept on my belly all the days of my life
like the serpent, but sometimes lift my forked crest or tread the
empyrean, wake thou out of thy mid-day slumbers! Shake off the
heavy honey-dew of thy soul, no longer lulled with that Circean cup,
drinking thy own thoughts with thy own ears, but start up in thy
promised likeness, and shake the pillared rottenness of the world!
Leave not thy sounding words in air, write them in marble, and
teach the coming age heroic truths! Up, and wake the echoes of
Time! Rich in deepest lore, die not the bed-rid churl of knowledge,
leaving the survivors unblest! Set, set as thou didst rise in pomp
and gladness! Dart like the sun-flower one broad, golden flash of
light; and ere thou ascendest thy native sky, shew us the steps by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>which thou didst scale the Heaven of philosophy, with Truth and
Fancy for thy equal guides, that we may catch thy mantle, rainbow-dipped,
and still read thy words dear to Memory, dearer to Fame!</p>

<p class='c013'>There is another branch of this character, which is the trifling or
dilatory character. Such persons are always creating difficulties,
and unable or unwilling to remove them. They cannot brush aside
a cobweb, and are stopped by an insect’s wing. Their character is
imbecility, rather than effeminacy. The want of energy and resolution
in the persons last described, arises from the habitual and inveterate
predominance of other feelings and motives; in these it is
a mere want of energy and resolution, that is, an inherent natural
defect of vigour of nerve and voluntary power. There is a specific
levity about such persons, so that you cannot propel them to any
object, or give them a decided <em>momentum</em> in any direction or pursuit.
They turn back, as it were, on the occasion that should project them
forward with manly force and vehemence. They shrink from
intrepidity of purpose, and are alarmed at the idea of attaining
their end too soon. They will not act with steadiness or spirit,
either for themselves or you. If you chalk out a line of conduct
for them, or commission them to execute a certain task, they are
sure to conjure up some insignificant objection or fanciful impediment
in the way, and are withheld from striking an effectual blow by mere
feebleness of character. They may be officious, good-natured,
friendly, generous in disposition, but they are of no use to any one.
They will put themselves to twice the trouble you desire, not to
carry your point, but to defeat it; and in obviating needless objections,
neglect the main business. If they do what you want, it is
neither at the time nor in the manner that you wish. This timidity
amounts to treachery; for by always anticipating some misfortune
or disgrace, they realise their unmeaning apprehensions. The little
bears sway in their minds over the great: a small inconvenience
outweighs a solid and indispensable advantage; and their strongest
bias is uniformly derived from the weakest motive. They hesitate
about the best way of beginning a thing till the opportunity for
action is lost, and are less anxious about its being done than the
precise manner of doing it. They will destroy a passage sooner
than let an objectionable word pass; and are much less concerned
about the truth or the beauty of an image, than about the reception
it will meet with from the critics. They alter what they write,
not because it is, but because it may possibly be wrong; and in
their tremulous solicitude to avoid imaginary blunders, run into real
ones. What is curious enough is, that with all this caution and
delicacy, they are continually liable to extraordinary oversights.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>They are in fact so full of all sorts of idle apprehensions, that they
do not know how to distinguish real from imaginary grounds of
apprehension; and they often give some unaccountable offence either
from assuming a sudden boldness half in sport, or while they are
secretly pluming themselves on their dexterity in avoiding every thing
exceptionable; and the same distraction of motive and short-sightedness
which gets them into scrapes, hinders them from seeing their
way out of them. Such persons (often of ingenious and susceptible
minds) are constantly at cross-purposes with themselves and others;
will neither do things nor let others do them; and whether they
succeed or fail, never feel confident or at their ease. They spoil the
freshness and originality of their own thoughts by asking contradictory
advice; and in befriending others while they are <em>about it and about
it</em>, you might have done the thing yourself a dozen times over.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is nothing more to be esteemed than a manly firmness
and decision of character. I like a person who knows his own
mind and sticks to it; who sees at once what is to be done in given
circumstances and does it. He does not beat about the bush for
difficulties or excuses, but goes the shortest and most effectual way
to work to attain his own ends, or to accomplish a useful object.
If he can serve you, he will do so; if he cannot, he will say so
without keeping you in needless suspense, or laying you under pretended
obligations. The applying to him in any laudable undertaking
is not like stirring ‘a dish of skimmed milk.’ There is stuff
in him, and it is of the right practicable sort. He is not all his
life at hawk and buzzard whether he shall be a Whig or a Tory,
a friend or a foe, a knave or a fool; but thinks that life is short,
and that there is no time to play fantastic tricks in it, to tamper with
principles, or trifle with individual feelings. If he gives you a
character, he does not add a damning clause to it: he does not
pick holes in you lest others should, or anticipate objections lest
he should be thought to be blinded by a childish partiality. His
object is to serve you; and not to play the game into your enemies’
hands.</p>

<p class='c015'>I should be sorry for any one to say what he did not think of me;
but I should not be pleased to see him slink out of his acknowledged
opinion, lest it should not be confirmed by malice or stupidity. He
who is well acquainted and well inclined to you, ought to give the
tone, not to receive it from others, and may set it to what key he
pleases in certain cases.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>There are those of whom it has been said, that to them an
obligation is a reason for not doing any thing, and there are others
who are invariably led to do the reverse of what they should. The
last are perverse, the first impracticable people. Opposed to the
effeminate in disposition and manners are the coarse and brutal. As
those were all softness and smoothness, these affect or are naturally
attracted to whatever is vulgar and violent, harsh and repulsive in
tone, in modes of speech, in forms of address, in gesture and behaviour.
Thus there are some who ape the lisping of the fine
lady, the drawling of the fine gentleman, and others who all their
lives delight in and catch the uncouth dialect, the manners and
expressions of clowns and hoydens. The last are governed by an
instinct of the disagreeable, by an appetite and headlong rage for
violating decorum, and hurting other people’s feelings, their own
being excited and enlivened by the shock. They deal in home
truths, unpleasant reflections, and unwelcome matters of fact; as
the others are all compliment and complaisance, insincerity and
insipidity.</p>

<p class='c013'>We may observe an effeminacy of style, in some degree corresponding
to effeminacy of character. Writers of this stamp are great
interliners of what they indite, alterers of indifferent phrases, and
the plague of printers’ devils. By an effeminate style I would be
understood to mean one that is all florid, all fine; that cloys by its
sweetness, and tires by its sameness. Such are what Dryden calls
‘calm, peaceable writers.’ They only aim to please, and never
offend by truth or disturb by singularity. Every thought must be
beautiful <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, every expression equally fine. They do not delight
in vulgarisms, but in common places, and dress out unmeaning forms
in all the colours of the rainbow. They do not go out of their way
to think—that would startle the indolence of the reader: they cannot
express a trite thought in common words—that would be a sacrifice
of their own vanity. They are not sparing of tinsel, for it costs
nothing. Their works should be printed, as they generally are, on
hot-pressed paper, with vignette margins. The Della Cruscan school
comes under this description, but is now nearly exploded. Lord
Byron is a pampered and aristocratic writer, but he is not effeminate,
or we should not have his works with only the printer’s name to
them! I cannot help thinking that the fault of Mr. Keats’s poems
was a deficiency in masculine energy of style. He had beauty,
tenderness, delicacy, in an uncommon degree, but there was a want
of strength and substance. His Endymion is a very delightful
description of the illusions of a youthful imagination, given up to
airy dreams—we have flowers, clouds, rainbows, moonlight, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>sweet sounds and smells, and Oreads and Dryads flitting by—but
there is nothing tangible in it, nothing marked or palpable—we
have none of the hardy spirit or rigid forms of antiquity. He
painted his own thoughts and character; and did not transport
himself into the fabulous and heroic ages. There is a want of action,
of character, and so far, of imagination, but there is exquisite fancy.
All is soft and fleshy, without bone or muscle. We see in him the
youth, without the manhood of poetry. His genius breathed ‘vernal
delight and joy.’—‘Like Maia’s son he stood and shook his plumes,’
with fragrance filled. His mind was redolent of spring. He had not
the fierceness of summer, nor the richness of autumn, and winter
he seemed not to have known, till he felt the icy hand of death!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XXVI<br /> <span class='small'>WHY DISTANT OBJECTS PLEASE</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>Distant objects please, because, in the first place, they imply an
idea of space and magnitude, and because, not being obtruded too
close upon the eye, we clothe them with the indistinct and airy
colours of fancy. In looking at the misty mountain-tops that bound
the horison, the mind is as it were conscious of all the conceivable
objects and interests that lie between; we imagine all sorts of
adventures in the interim; strain our hopes and wishes to reach
the air-drawn circle, or to ‘descry new lands, rivers, and mountains,’
stretching far beyond it: our feelings carried out of themselves lose
their grossness and their husk, are rarefied, expanded, melt into softness
and brighten into beauty, turning to ethereal mould, sky-tinctured.
We drink the air before us, and borrow a more refined existence from
objects that hover on the brink of nothing. Where the landscape
fades from the dull sight, we fill the thin, viewless space with shapes
of unknown good, and tinge the hazy prospect with hopes and wishes
and more charming fears.</p>

<p class='c015'>Whatever is placed beyond the reach of sense and knowledge, whatever
is imperfectly discerned, the fancy pieces out at its leisure; and
all but the present moment, but the present spot, passion claims for its
own, and brooding over it with wings outspread, stamps it with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>image of itself. Passion is lord of infinite space, and distant objects
please because they border on its confines, and are moulded by its
touch. When I was a boy, I lived within sight of a range of lofty
hills, whose blue tops blending with the setting sun had often tempted
my longing eyes and wandering feet. At last I put my project in
execution, and on a nearer approach, instead of glimmering air woven
into fantastic shapes, found them huge lumpish heaps of discoloured
earth. I learnt from this (in part) to leave ‘Yarrow unvisited,’ and
not idly to disturb a dream of good!</p>

<p class='c013'>Distance of time has much the same effect as distance of place.
It is not surprising that fancy colours the prospect of the future as it
thinks good, when it even effaces the forms of memory. Time takes
out the sting of pain; our sorrows after a certain period have been so
often steeped in a medium of thought and passion, that they ‘unmould
their essence;’ and all that remains of our original impressions is
what we would wish them to have been. Not only the untried steep
ascent before us, but the rude, unsightly masses of our past experience
presently resume their power of deception over the eye: the golden
cloud soon rests upon their heads, and the purple light of fancy
clothes their barren sides! Thus we pass on, while both ends of our
existence touch upon Heaven!—There is (so to speak) ‘a mighty
stream of tendency’ to good in the human mind, upon which all
objects float and are imperceptibly borne along: and though in the
voyage of life we meet with strong rebuffs, with rocks and quicksands,
yet there is ‘a tide in the affairs of men,’ a heaving and a restless
aspiration of the soul, by means of which, ‘with sails and tackle torn,’
the wreck and scattered fragments of our entire being drift into the
port and haven of our desires! In all that relates to the affections,
we put the will for the deed:—so that the instant the pressure of
unwelcome circumstances is removed, the mind recoils from their
hold, recovers its elasticity, and re-unites itself to that image of good,
which is but a reflection and configuration of its own nature. Seen
in the distance, in the long perspective of waning years, the meanest
incidents, enlarged and enriched by countless recollections, become
interesting; the most painful, broken and softened by time, soothe.
How any object, that unexpectedly brings back to us old scenes and
associations, startles the mind! What a yearning it creates within
us; what a longing to leap the intermediate space! How fondly we
cling to, and try to revive the impression of all that we then were!</p>

<p class='c015'>In truth, we impose upon ourselves, and know not what we wish. It
is a cunning artifice, a quaint delusion, by which, in pretending to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>what we were at a particular moment of time, we would fain be all
that we have since been, and have our lives to come over again. It
is not the little, glimmering, almost annihilated speck in the distance,
that rivets our attention and ‘hangs upon the beatings of our hearts:’
it is the interval that separates us from it, and of which it is the
trembling boundary, that excites all this coil and mighty pudder in
the breast. Into that great gap in our being ‘come thronging soft
desires’ and infinite regrets. It is the contrast, the change from
what we then were, that arms the half-extinguished recollection with
its giant-strength, and lifts the fabric of the affections from its
shadowy base. In contemplating its utmost verge, we overlook the
map of our existence, and re-tread, in apprehension, the journey of
life. So it is that in early youth we strain our eager sight after
the pursuits of manhood; and, as we are sliding off the stage, strive
to gather up the toys and flowers that pleased our thoughtless
childhood.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I was quite a boy, my father used to take me to the
Montpelier Tea-gardens at Walworth. Do I go there now? No;
the place is deserted, and its borders and its beds o’erturned. Is
there, then, nothing that can</p>

      <div class='line'>Of glory in the grass, of splendour in the flower?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Oh! yes. I unlock the casket of memory, and draw back the
warders of the brain; and there this scene of my infant wanderings
still lives unfaded, or with fresher dyes. A new sense comes upon
me, as in a dream; a richer perfume, brighter colours start out; my
eyes dazzle; my heart heaves with its new load of bliss, and I am
a child again. My sensations are all glossy, spruce, voluptuous, and
fine: they wear a candied coat, and are in holiday trim. I see the
beds of larkspur with purple eyes; tall holy-oaks, red and yellow;
the broad sun-flowers, caked in gold, with bees buzzing round them;
wildernesses of pinks, and hot-glowing pionies; poppies run to seed;
the sugared lily, and faint mignionette, all ranged in order, and as
thick as they can grow; the box-tree borders; the gravel-walks, the
painted alcove, the confectionary, the clotted cream:—I think I see
them now with sparkling looks; or have they vanished while I have
been writing this description of them? No matter; they will return
again when I least think of them. All that I have observed since,
of flowers and plants, and grass-plots, and of suburb delights, seems,
to me, borrowed from ‘that first garden of my innocence’—to be
slips and scions stolen from that bed of memory. In this manner the
darlings of our childhood burnish out in the eye of after-years, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>derive their sweetest perfume from the first heartfelt sigh of pleasure
breathed upon them,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>—‘like the sweet south,</div>
      <div class='line'>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stealing and giving odour!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>If I have pleasure in a flower-garden, I have in a kitchen-garden too,
and for the same reason. If I see a row of cabbage-plants or of peas
or beans coming up, I immediately think of those which I used so
carefully to water of an evening at W—m, when my day’s tasks
were done, and of the pain with which I saw them droop and hang
down their leaves in the morning’s sun. Again, I never see a child’s
kite in the air, but it seems to pull at my heart. It is to me a ‘thing
of life.’ I feel the twinge at my elbow, the flutter and palpitation,
with which I used to let go the string of my own, as it rose in the
air and towered among the clouds. My little cargo of hopes and
fears ascended with it; and as it made a part of my own consciousness
then, it does so still, and appears ‘like some gay creature of the
element,’ my playmate when life was young, and twin-born with
my earliest recollections. I could enlarge on this subject of childish
amusements, but Mr. Leigh Hunt has treated it so well, in a paper
in the <em>Indicator</em>, on the productions of the toy-shops of the metropolis,
that if I were to insist more on it, I should only pass for an imitator
of that ingenious and agreeable writer, <em>and for an indifferent one into
the bargain</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sounds, smells, and sometimes tastes, are remembered longer than
visible objects, and serve, perhaps, better for links in the chain of
association. The reason seems to be this: they are in their nature
intermittent, and comparatively rare; whereas objects of sight are
always before us, and, by their continuous succession, drive one
another out. The eye is always open; and between any given
impression and its recurrence a second time, fifty thousand other
impressions have, in all likelihood, been stamped upon the sense and
on the brain. The other senses are not so active or vigilant. They
are but seldom called into play. The ear, for example, is oftener
courted by silence than noise; and the sounds that break that silence
sink deeper and more durably into the mind. I have a more present
and lively recollection of certain scents, tastes, and sounds, for this
reason, than I have of mere visible images, because they are more
original, and less worn by frequent repetition. Where there is
nothing interposed between any two impressions, whatever the
distance of time that parts them, they naturally seem to touch; and
the renewed impression recals the former one in full force, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>distraction or competitor. The taste of barberries, which have hung
out in the snow during the severity of a North American winter,
I have in my mouth still, after an interval of thirty years; for I have
met with no other taste, in all that time, at all like it. It remains by
itself, almost like the impression of a sixth sense. But the colour is
mixed up indiscriminately with the colours of many other berries, nor
should I be able to distinguish it among them. The smell of a brick-kiln
carries the evidence of its own identity with it: neither is it to
me (from peculiar associations) unpleasant. The colour of brick-dust,
on the contrary, is more common, and easily confounded with
other colours. Raphael did not keep it quite distinct from his flesh-colour.
I will not say that we have a more perfect recollection of
the human voice than of that complex picture the human face, but
I think the sudden hearing of a well-known voice has something in it
more affecting and striking than the sudden meeting with the face:
perhaps, indeed, this may be because we have a more familiar
remembrance of the one than the other, and the voice takes us more
by surprise on that account. I am by no means certain (generally
speaking) that we have the ideas of the other senses so accurate and
well-made out as those of visible form: what I chiefly mean is, that
the feelings belonging to the sensations of our other organs, when
accidentally recalled, are kept more separate and pure. Musical
sounds, probably, owe a good deal of their interest and romantic
effect to the principle here spoken of. Were they constant, they
would become indifferent, as we may find with respect to disagreeable
noises, which we do not hear after a time. I know no situation more
pitiable than that of a blind fiddler, who has but one sense left (if we
except the sense of snuff-taking<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a>) and who has that stunned or
deafened by his own villanous noises. Shakespear says,</p>

<p class='c015'>It has been observed, in explanation of this passage, that it is because
in the day-time lovers are occupied with one another’s faces, but that
at night they can only distinguish the sound of each other’s voices.

<p class='c015'>and charm the moonlight air with its balmy essence, that the budding
leaves trembled to its accents. Would I might have heard it once
more whisper peace and hope (as erst when it was mingled with the
breath of spring), and with its soft pulsations lift winged fancy to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>heaven! But it has ceased, or turned where I no more shall hear it!—Hence,
also, we see what is the charm of the shepherd’s pastoral
reed; and why we hear him, as it were, piping to his flock, even in
a picture. Our ears are fancy-stung! I remember once strolling
along the margin of a stream, skirted with willows and plashy sedges,
in one of those low sheltered valleys on Salisbury Plain, where the
monks of former ages had planted chapels and built hermits’ cells.
There was a little parish-church near, but tall elms and quivering
alders hid it from my sight, when, all of a sudden, I was startled by
the sound of the full organ pealing on the ear, accompanied by rustic
voices and the willing quire of village-maids and children. It rose,
indeed, ‘like an exhalation of rich distilled perfumes.’ The dew
from a thousand pastures was gathered in its softness; the silence of
a thousand years spoke in it. It came upon the heart like the calm
beauty of death: fancy caught the sound, and faith mounted on it to
the skies. It filled the valley like a mist, and still poured out its
endless chant, and still it swells upon the ear, and wraps me in a
golden trance, drowning the noisy tumult of the world!</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a curious and interesting discussion, on the comparative
distinctness of our visual and other external impressions, in Mr.
Fearn’s Essay on Consciousness, with which I shall try to descend
from this rhapsody to the ground of common sense and plain reasoning
again. After observing, a little before, that ‘nothing is more untrue
than that sensations of vision do necessarily leave more vivid and
durable ideas than those of grosser senses,’ he proceeds to give a
number of illustrations in support of this position. ‘Notwithstanding,’
he says, ‘the advantages here enumerated in favour of sight, I think
there is no doubt that a man will come to forget acquaintance, and
many other visible objects, noticed in mature age, before he will in
the least forget tastes and smells, of only moderate interest, encountered
either in his childhood, or at any time since.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘In the course of voyaging to various distant regions, it has several
times happened that I have eaten once or twice of different things
that never came in my way before nor since. Some of these have
been pleasant, and some scarce better than insipid; but I have no
reason to think I have forgot, or much altered the ideas left by those
single impulses of taste; though here the memory of them certainly
has not been preserved by repetition. It is clear I must have seen, as
well as tasted those things; and I am decided that I remember the
tastes with more precision than I do the visual sensations.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I remember having once, and only once, eat Kangaroo in New
Holland; and having once smelled a baker’s shop, having a peculiar
odour, in the city of Bassorah. Now both these gross ideas remain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>with me quite as vivid as any visual ideas of those places; and this
could not be from repetition, but really from interest in the sensation.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Twenty-eight years ago, in the island of Jamaica, I partook
(perhaps twice) of a certain fruit, of the taste of which I have
now a very fresh idea; and I could add other instances of that
period.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I have had repeated proofs of having lost retention of visual
objects, at various distances of time, though they had once been
familiar. I have not, during thirty years, forgot the delicate, and in
itself most trifling sensation, that the palm of my hand used to convey,
when I was a boy, trying the different effects of what boys call <em>light</em>
and <em>heavy</em> tops; but I cannot remember within several shades of the
brown coat which I left off a week ago. If any man thinks he can
do better, let him take an ideal survey of his wardrobe, and then
actually refer to it for proof.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘After retention of such ideas, it certainly would be very difficult
to persuade me that feeling, taste, and smell can scarce be said to
leave ideas, unless indistinct and obscure ones....</p>

chance.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘If he is an architect, he may be much more correct than any
ordinary person: and this obviously is, because he has felt an interest
in viewing these structures, which an ordinary person does not feel:
and here interest is the sole reason of his remembering more correctly
than his neighbour.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I once heard a person quaintly ask another, How many trees there
are in St. Paul’s churchyard? The question itself indicates that
many cannot answer it; and this is found to be the case with those
who have passed the church an hundred times: whilst the cause is,
that every individual in the busy stream which glides past St. Paul’s
is engrossed in various other interests.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘How often does it happen that we enter a well-known apartment,
or meet a well-known friend, and receive some vague idea of visible
difference, but cannot possibly find out <em>what</em> it is; until at length we
come to perceive (or perhaps must be told) that some ornament or
furniture is removed, altered, or added in the apartment; or that our
friend has cut his hair, taken a wig, or has made any of twenty
considerable alterations in his appearance. At other times, we have
no perception of alteration whatever, though the like has taken
place.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>‘It is, however, certain, that sight, apposited with interest, can
retain tolerably exact copies of sensations, especially if not too
complex; such as of the human countenance and figure. Yet the
voice will convince us, when the countenance will not; and he is
reckoned an excellent painter, and no ordinary genius, who can make
a tolerable likeness from memory. Nay, more, it is a conspicuous
proof of the inaccuracy of visual ideas, that it is an effort of consummate
art, attained by many years’ practice, to take a strict likeness of
the human countenance, even when the object is present; and among
those cases, where the wilful cheat of flattery has been avoided, we
still find in how very few instances the best painters produce a
likeness up to the life, though practice and interest join in the
attempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I imagine an ordinary person would find it very difficult, supposing
he had some knowledge of drawing, to afford, from memory, a
tolerable sketch of such a familiar object as his curtain, his carpet, or
his dressing-gown, if the pattern of either be at all various or irregular;
yet he will instantly tell, with precision, either if his snuff or his wine
has not the same character it had yesterday, though both these are
compounds.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Beyond all this I may observe, that a draper, who is in the daily
habit of such comparisons, cannot carry in his mind the particular
shade of a colour during a second of time; and has no certainty of
tolerably matching two simple colours, except by placing the patterns
in contact.’—<cite>Essay on Consciousness</cite>, p. 303</p>

<p class='c013'>I will conclude the subject of this Essay with observing, that (as it
appears to me) a nearer and more familiar acquaintance with persons
has a different and more favourable effect than that with places or
things. The latter improve (as an almost universal rule) by being
removed to a distance: the former, generally at least, gain by being
brought nearer and more home to us. Report or imagination seldom
raises any individual so high in our estimation as to disappoint us
greatly when we are introduced to him: prejudice and malice
constantly exaggerate defects beyond the reality. Ignorance alone
makes monsters or bugbears: our actual acquaintances are all very
common-place people. The thing is, that as a matter of hearsay or
conjecture, we make abstractions of particular vices, and irritate
ourselves against some particular quality or action of the person we
dislike:—whereas, individuals are concrete existences, not arbitrary
denominations or nicknames; and have innumerable other qualities,
good, bad, and indifferent, besides the damning feature with which
we fill up the portrait or caricature, in our previous fancies. We can
scarcely hate any one that we know. An acute observer complained,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>that if there was any one to whom he had a particular spite, and a
wish to let him see it, the moment he came to sit down with him,
his enmity was disarmed by some unforeseen circumstance. If it was
a Quarterly Reviewer, he was in other respects like any other man.
Suppose, again, your adversary turns out a very ugly man, or wants
an eye, you are balked in that way:—he is not what you expected,
the object of your abstract hatred and implacable disgust. He may
be a very disagreeable person, but he is no longer the same. If you
come into a room where a man is, you find, in general, that he has a
nose upon his face. ‘There’s sympathy!’ This alone is a diversion
to your unqualified contempt. He is stupid, and says nothing, but he
seems to have something in him when he laughs. You had conceived
of him as a rank Whig or Tory—yet he talks upon other subjects.
You knew that he was a virulent party-writer; but you find that the
man himself is a tame sort of animal enough. He does not bite.
That’s something. In short, you can make nothing of it. Even
opposite vices balance one another. A man may be pert in company,
but he is also dull; so that you cannot, though you try, hate him
cordially, merely for the wish to be offensive. He is a knave.
Granted. You learn, on a nearer acquaintance, what you did not
know before—that he is a fool as well; so you forgive him. On
the other hand, he may be a profligate public character, and may
make no secret of it; but he gives you a hearty shake by the hand,
speaks kindly to servants, and supports an aged father and mother.
Politics apart, he is a very honest fellow. You are told that a person
has carbuncles on his face; but you have ocular proofs that he is
sallow, and pale as a ghost. This does not much mend the matter;
but it blunts the edge of the ridicule, and turns your indignation
against the inventor of the lie; but he is —, the editor of a Scotch
magazine; so you are just where you were. I am not very fond of
anonymous criticism; I want to know who the author can be: but
the moment I learn this, I am satisfied. Even — would do well
to come out of his disguise. It is the mask only that we dread and
hate: the man may have something human about him! The notions,
in short, which we entertain of people at a distance, or from partial
representations, or from guess-work, are simple, uncompounded ideas,
which answer to nothing in reality: those which we derive from
experience are mixed modes, the only true, and, in general, the most
favourable ones. Instead of naked deformity, or abstract perfection—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>‘Corporate bodies have no soul.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Corporate bodies are more corrupt and profligate than individuals,
because they have more power to do mischief, and are less amenable
to disgrace or punishment. They feel neither shame, remorse,
gratitude, nor good-will. The principle of private or natural conscience
is extinguished in each individual (we have no moral sense in
the breasts of others), and nothing is considered but how the united
efforts of the whole (released from idle scruples) may be best directed
to the obtaining of political advantages and privileges to be shared as
common spoil. Each member reaps the benefit, and lays the blame,
if there is any, upon the rest. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> becomes the ruling
passion of every corporate body, compared with which the motives of
delicacy or decorum towards others are looked upon as being both
impertinent and improper. If any person sets up a plea of this sort
in opposition to the rest, he is over-ruled, he gets ill-blood, and does
no good: he is regarded as an interloper, a <em>black sheep</em> in the flock,
and is either <em>sent to Coventry</em>, or obliged to acquiesce in the notions
and wishes of those he associates and is expected to co-operate with.
The refinements of private judgment are referred to and negatived in
a committee of the whole body, while the projects and interests of
the Corporation meet with a secret but powerful support in the self-love
of the different members. Remonstrance—opposition, is fruitless,
troublesome, invidious: it answers no one end: and a conformity to
the sense of the company is found to be no less necessary to a reputation
for good-fellowship than to a quiet life. ‘Self-love and social’
here look like the same; and in consulting the interests of a particular
class, which are also your own, there is even a show of public virtue.
He who is a captious, impracticable, dissatisfied member of his little
club or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coterie</span></i>, is immediately set down as a bad member of the
community in general, as no friend to regularity and order, ‘a pestilent
fellow,’ and one who is incapable of sympathy, attachment, or cordial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>co-operation in any department or undertaking. Thus the most
refractory novice in such matters becomes weaned from his obligations
to the larger society, which only breed him inconvenience
without any adequate recompense, and wedded to a nearer and dearer
one, where he finds every kind of comfort and consolation. He
contracts the vague and unmeaning character of Man into the more
emphatic title of Freeman and Alderman. The claims of an
undefined humanity sit looser and looser upon him, at the same time
that he draws the bands of his new engagements closer and tighter
about him. He loses sight, by degrees, of all common sense and
feeling in the petty squabbles, intrigues, feuds, and airs, of affected
importance to which he has made himself an accessary. He is quite
an altered man. ‘Really the society were under considerable obligation
to him in that last business;’ that is to say, in some paltry job
or under-hand attempt to encroach upon the rights, or dictate to the
understandings of the neighbourhood. In the mean time, they eat,
drink, and carouse together. They wash down all minor animosities
and unavoidable differences of opinion in pint-bumpers; and the
complaints of the multitude are lost in the clatter of plates and
the roaring of loyal catches at every quarter’s meeting or mayor’s
feast. The town-hall reels with an unwieldy sense of self-importance:
‘the very stones prate’ of processions: the common pump creaks in
concert with the uncorking of bottles and tapping of beer-barrels:
the market-cross looks big with authority. Every thing has an
ambiguous, upstart, repulsive air. Circle within circle is formed, an
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium in imperio</span></i>: and the business is to exclude from the first
circle all the notions, opinions, ideas, interests, and pretensions, of the
second. Hence there arises not only an antipathy to common sense
and decency in those things where there is a real opposition of interest
or clashing of prejudice, but it becomes a habit and a favourite
amusement in those who are ‘dressed in a little brief authority,’ to
thwart, annoy, insult, and harass others on all occasions where the
least opportunity or pretext for it occurs. Spite, bickerings, backbiting,
insinuations, lies, jealousies, nicknames, are the order of the
day, and nobody knows what it’s all about. One would think that
the mayor, aldermen, and liverymen, were a higher and more select
species of animals than their townsmen; though there is no difference
whatever but in their gowns and staff of office! This is the essence
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>. It is certainly not a very delectable source of
contemplation or subject to treat of.</p>

<p class='c013'>Public bodies are so far worse than the individuals composing
them, because the <em>official</em> takes place of the <em>moral sense</em>. The nerves
that in themselves were soft and pliable enough, and responded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>naturally to the touch of pity, when fastened into a machine of that
sort, become callous and rigid, and throw off every extraneous
application that can be made to them with perfect apathy. An appeal
is made to the ties of individual friendship: the body in general
know nothing of them. A case has occurred which strongly called
forth the compassion of the person who was witness of it: but the
body (or any special deputation of them) were not present when it
happened. These little weaknesses and ‘compunctious visitings of
nature’ are effectually guarded against, indeed, by the very rules and
regulations of the society, as well as by its spirit. The individual is
the creature of his feelings of all sorts, the sport of his vices and his
virtues—like the fool in Shakespear, ‘motley’s his proper wear:’—corporate
bodies are dressed in a moral uniform; mixed motives do
not operate there, frailty is made into a system, ‘diseases are turned
into commodities.’ Only so much of any one’s natural or genuine
impulses can influence him in his artificial capacity as formally comes
home to the aggregate conscience of those with whom he acts, or
bears upon the interests (real or pretended), the importance, respectability,
and professed objects of the society. Beyond that point the
nerve is bound up, the conscience is seared, and the torpedo-touch of
so much inert matter operates to deaden the best feelings and harden
the heart. Laughter and tears are said to be the characteristic signs
of humanity. Laughter is common enough in such places as a set-off
to the mock-gravity: but who ever saw a public body in tears?
Nothing but a job or some knavery can keep them serious for ten
minutes together.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Such are the qualifications and the apprenticeship necessary to
make a man tolerated, to enable him to pass as a cypher, or be
admitted as a mere numerical unit, in any corporate body: to be a
leader and dictator, he must be diplomatic in impertinence, and
officious in every dirty work. He must not merely conform to
established prejudices; he must flatter them. He must not merely
be insensible to the demands of moderation and equity; he must be
loud against them. He must not simply fall in with all sorts of
contemptible cabals and intrigues; he must be indefatigable in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>fomenting them, and setting every body together by the ears. He
must not only repeat, but invent lies. He must make speeches and
write hand-bills; he must be devoted to the wishes and objects of the
society, its creature, its jackall, its busy-body, its mouthpiece, its
prompter; he must deal in law-cases, in demurrers, in charters, in
traditions, in common-places, in logic and rhetoric—in every thing
but common sense and honesty. He must (in Mr. Burke’s phrase)
‘disembowel himself of his natural entrails, and be stuffed with paltry,
blurred sheets of parchment about the rights’ of the privileged few.
He must be a concentrated essence, a varnished, powdered, representative
of the vices, absurdities, hypocrisy, jealousy, pride, and
pragmaticalness of his party. Such a one by bustle and self-importance
and puffing, by flattering one to his face, and abusing
another behind his back, by lending himself to the weaknesses of
some, and pampering the mischievous propensities of others, will pass
for a great man in a little society.</p>

<p class='c013'>Age does not improve the morality of public bodies. They grow
more and more tenacious of their idle privileges and senseless self-consequence.
They get weak and obstinate at the same time. Those,
who belong to them, have all the upstart pride and pettifogging spirit
of their present character ingrafted on the venerableness and superstitious
sanctity of ancient institutions. They are naturally at issue,
first with their neighbours, and next with their contemporaries, on all
matters of common propriety and judgment. They become more
attached to forms, the more obsolete they are; and the defence of
every absurd and invidious distinction is a debt which (by implication)
they owe to the dead as well as the living. What might once
have been of serious practical utility they turn to farce, by retaining
the letter when the spirit is gone: and they do this the more, the
more glaring the inconsistency and want of sound reasoning; for they
think they thus give proof of their zeal and attachment to the
abstract principle on which old establishments exist, the ground of
prescription and authority. <em>The greater the ‘wrong, the greater the
right</em>, in all such cases. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> does not take much merit
to itself for upholding what is justifiable in any system, or the
proceedings of any party, but for adhering to what is palpably
injurious. You may exact the first from an enemy: the last is the
province of a friend. It has been made a subject of complaint,
that the champions of the Church, for example, who are advanced
to dignities and honours, are hardly ever those who defend the
common principles of Christianity, but those who volunteer to man
the out-works, and set up ingenious excuses for the questionable points,
the ticklish places in the established form of worship, that is, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>those which are attacked from without, and are supposed in danger
of being undermined by stratagem, or carried by assault!</p>

<p class='c013'>The great resorts and seats of learning often outlive in this way
the intention of the founders, as the world outgrows them. They
may be said to resemble antiquated coquets of the last age, who
think every thing ridiculous and intolerable but what was in fashion
when they were young, and yet are standing proofs of the progress
of taste, and the vanity of human pretensions. Our universities are,
in a great measure, become cisterns to hold, not conduits to disperse
knowledge. The age has the start of them; that is, other sources
of knowledge have been opened since their formation, to which the
world have had access, and have drunk plentifully at those living
fountains, but from which they are debarred by the tenor of their
charter, and as a matter of dignity and privilege. They have grown
poor, like the old grandees in some countries, by subsisting on the
inheritance of learning, while the people have grown rich by trade.
They are too much in the nature of <em>fixtures</em> in intellect: they stop
the way in the road to truth; or at any rate (for they do not themselves
advance) they can only be of service as a check-weight on
the too hasty and rapid career of innovation. All that has been
invented or thought in the last two hundred years they take no
cognisance of, or as little as possible; they are above it; they stand
upon the ancient landmarks, and will not budge; whatever was
not known when they were first endowed, they are still in profound
and lofty ignorance of. Yet in that period how much has been
done in literature, arts, and science, of which (with the exception
of mathematical knowledge, the hardest to gainsay or subject to
the trammels of prejudice and barbarous <em>ipse dixits</em>) scarce any
trace is to be found in the authentic modes of study, and legitimate
inquiry, which prevail at either of our Universities! The unavoidable
aim of all corporate bodies of learning is not to grow
wise, or teach others wisdom, but to prevent any one else from
being or seeming wiser than themselves; in other words, their
infallible tendency is in the end to suppress inquiry and darken
knowledge, by setting limits to the mind of man, and saying to
his proud spirit, <em>Hitherto shalt thou come, and no farther!</em> It would
not be an unedifying experiment to make a collection of the titles
of works published in the course of the year by Members of the
Universities. If any attempt is to be made to patch up an idle
system in policy or legislation, or church-government, it is by a
Member of the University: if any hashed-up speculation on an
old exploded argument is to be brought forward ‘in spite of <em>shame</em>,
in erring reason’s spite,’ it is by a Member of the University: if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>a paltry project is ushered into the world for combining ancient
prejudices with modern time-serving, it is by a Member of the
University. Thus we get at a stated supply of annual Defences
of the Sinking Fund, Thoughts on the Evils of Education, Treatises
on Predestination, and Eulogies on Mr. Malthus, all from the same
source, and through the same vent. If they came from any other
quarter nobody would look at them; but they have an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Imprimatur</span></i>
from dulness and authority: we know that there is no offence in
them; and they are stuck in the shop-windows, and read (in the
intervals of Lord Byron’s works, or the Scotch novels) in cathedral
towns and close boroughs!</p>

<p class='c013'>It is, I understand and believe, pretty much the same in more
modern institutions for the encouragement of the Fine Arts. The
end is lost in the means: rules take place of nature and genius;
cabal and bustle, and struggles for rank and precedence, supersede
the study and the love of art. A Royal Academy is a kind of
hospital and infirmary for the obliquities of taste and ingenuity—a
receptacle where enthusiasm and originality stop and stagnate, and
spread their influence no farther, instead of being a school founded
for genius, or a temple built to fame. The generality of those
who wriggle, or fawn, or beg their way to a seat there, live on
their certificate of merit to a good old age, and are seldom heard
of afterwards. If a man of sterling capacity gets among them, and
minds his own business, he is nobody; he makes no figure in
council, in voting, in resolutions or speeches. If he comes forward
with plans and views for the good of the Academy and the advancement
of art, he is immediately set upon as a visionary, a fanatic,
with notions hostile to the interest and credit of the existing members
of the society. If he directs the ambition of the scholars to the
study of History, this strikes at once at the emoluments of the
profession, who are most of them (by God’s will) portrait painters.
If he eulogises the Antique, and speaks highly of the Old Masters,
he is supposed to be actuated by envy to living painters and native
talent. If, again, he insists on a knowledge of anatomy as essential
to correct drawing, this would seem to imply a want of it in our
most eminent designers. Every plan, suggestion, argument, that
has the general purposes and principles of art for its object, is
thwarted, scouted, ridiculed, slandered, as having a malignant aspect
towards the profits and pretensions of the great mass of flourishing
and respectable artists in the country. This leads to irritation and
ill-will on all sides. The obstinacy of the constituted authorities
keeps pace with the violence and extravagance opposed to it; and
they lay all the blame on the folly and mistakes they have themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>occasioned or increased. It is considered as a personal quarrel, not
a public question; by which means the dignity of the body is
implicated in resenting the slips and inadvertencies of its members,
not in promoting their common and declared objects. In this sort
of wretched <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tracasserie</span></i> the Barrys and H—s stand no chance
with the Catons, the Tubbs, and the F—s. Sir Joshua even
was obliged to hold himself aloof from them, and Fuseli passes as
a kind of nondescript, or one of his own grotesques. The air of
an academy, in short, is not the air of genius and immortality; it
is too close and heated, and impregnated with the notions of the
common sort. A man steeped in a corrupt atmosphere of this
description is no longer open to the genial impulses of nature and
truth, nor sees visions of ideal beauty, nor dreams of antique grace
and grandeur, nor has the finest works of art continually hovering
and floating through his uplifted fancy; but the images that haunt
it are rules of the academy, charters, inaugural speeches, resolutions
passed or rescinded, cards of invitation to a council-meeting, or the
annual dinner, prize-medals, and the king’s diploma, constituting him
a gentleman and esquire. He ‘wipes out all trivial, fond records;’
all romantic aspirations; ‘the Raphael grace, the Guido air;’ and
the commands of the academy alone ‘must live within the book and
volume of his brain, unmixed with baser matter.’ It may be
doubted whether any work of lasting reputation and universal interest
can spring up in this soil, or ever has done in that of any academy.
The last question is a matter of fact and history, not of mere opinion
or prejudice; and may be ascertained as such accordingly. The
mighty names of former times rose before the existence of academies;
and the three greatest painters, undoubtedly, that this country has
produced, Reynolds, Wilson, and Hogarth, were not ‘dandled and
swaddled’ into artists in any institution for the fine arts. I do not
apprehend that the names of Chantry or Wilkie, (great as one, and
considerable as the other of them is,) can be made use of in any
way to impugn the jet of this argument. We may find a considerable
improvement in some of our artists, when they get out of the
vortex for a time. Sir Thomas Lawrence is all the better for
having been abstracted for a year or two from Somerset-House;
and Mr. Dawe, they say, has been doing wonders in the North.
When will he return, and once more ‘bid Britannia rival Greece?’</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Canning somewhere lays it down as a rule, that corporate
bodies are necessarily correct and pure in their conduct, from the
knowledge which the individuals composing them have of one
another, and the jealous vigilance they exercise over each other’s
motives and characters; whereas, people collected into mobs are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>disorderly and unprincipled from being utterly unknown and unaccountable
to each other. This is a curious <em>pass</em> of wit. I differ
with him in both parts of the dilemma. To begin with the first,
and to handle it somewhat cavalierly, according to the model before
us: we know, for instance, there is said to be honour among thieves,
but very little honesty towards others. Their honour consists in
the division of the booty, not in the mode of acquiring it: they do
not (often) betray one another, but they will waylay a stranger,
or knock out a traveller’s brains: they may be depended on in
giving the alarm when any of their posts are in danger of being
surprised; and they will stand together for their ill-gotten gains
to the last drop of their blood. Yet they form a distinct society,
and are strictly responsible for their behaviour to one another and
to their leader. They are not a mob, but a <em>gang</em>, completely in
one another’s power and secrets. Their familiarity, however, with
the proceedings of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps</span></i>, does not lead them to expect or to
exact from it a very high standard of moral honesty; that is out
of the question; but they are sure to gain the good opinion of their
fellows by committing all sorts of depredations, fraud, and violence
against the community at large. So (not to speak it profanely) some
of Mr. C—’s friends may be very respectable people in their way—‘all
honourable men’—but their respectability is confined within
party-limits; every one does not sympathise in the integrity of their
views; the understanding between them and the public is not well-defined
or reciprocal. Or, suppose a gang of pickpockets hustle a
passenger in the street, and the mob set upon them, and proceed to
execute summary justice upon such as they can lay hands on, am I
to conclude that the rogues are in the right, because theirs is a system
of well-organised knavery, which they settled in the morning, with
their eyes one upon the other, and which they regularly review at
night, with a due estimate of each other’s motives, character, and
conduct in the business; and that the honest men are in the wrong,
because they are a casual collection of unprejudiced, disinterested
individuals, taken at a venture from the mass of the people, acting
without concert or responsibility, on the spur of the occasion, and
giving way to their instantaneous impulses and honest anger? Mobs,
in fact, then, are almost always right in their feelings, and often in
their judgments, on this very account—that being utterly unknown
to and disconnected with each other, they have no point of union or
principle of co-operation between them, but the natural sense of
justice recognised by all persons in common. They appeal, at the
first meeting, not to certain symbols and watch-words privately agreed
upon, like Free-Masons, but to the maxims and instincts proper to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>all the world. They have no other clew to guide them to their
object but either the dictates of the heart, or the universally understood
sentiments of society, neither of which are likely to be in the
wrong. The flame, which bursts out and blazes from popular
sympathy, is made of honest, but homely materials. It is not
kindled by sparks of wit or sophistry, nor damped by the cold
calculations of self-interest. The multitude may be wantonly set on
by others, as is too often the case, or be carried too far in the impulse
of rage and disappointment; but their resentment, when they are
left to themselves, is almost uniformly, in the first instance, excited
by some evident abuse and wrong; and the excesses into which they
run arise from that very want of foresight and regular system, which
is a pledge of the uprightness and heartiness of their intentions. In
short, the only class of persons to whom the above courtly charge
of sinister and corrupt motives is not applicable, is that body of
individuals which usually goes by the name of the <em>People</em>!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XXVIII<br /> <span class='small'>WHETHER ACTORS OUGHT TO SIT IN THE BOXES?</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>I think not; and that for the following reasons, as well as I can give
them:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Actors belong to the public: their persons are not their own
property. They exhibit themselves on the stage: that is enough,
without displaying themselves in the boxes of the theatre. I conceive
that an actor, on account of the very circumstances of his profession,
ought to keep himself as much <em>incognito</em> as possible. He plays a
number of parts disguised, transformed into them as much as he can
‘by his so potent art,’ and he should not disturb this borrowed impression
by unmasking before company, more than he can help. Let
him go into the pit, if he pleases, to see—not into the first circle, to
be seen. He is seen enough without that: he is the centre of an
illusion that he is bound to support, both, as it appears to me, by a
certain self-respect which should repel idle curiosity, and by a certain
deference to the public, in whom he has inspired certain prejudices
which he is covenanted not to break. He represents the majesty of
successive kings; he takes the responsibility of heroes and lovers on
himself; the mantle of genius and nature falls on his shoulders; we
‘pile millions’ of associations on him, under which he should be
‘buried quick,’ and not perk out an inauspicious face upon us, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>a plain-cut coat, to say—‘What fools you all were!—I am not
Hamlet the Dane!’</p>

<p class='c013'>It is very well and in strict propriety for Mr. Matthews, in his
At Home, after he has been imitating his inimitable Scotchwoman,
to slip out as quick as lightning, and appear in the side-box shaking
hands with our old friend Jack Bannister. It adds to our surprise
at the versatility of his changes of place and appearance, and he had
been before us in his own person during a great part of the evening.
There was no harm done—no imaginary spell broken—no discontinuity
of thought or sentiment. Mr. Matthews is himself (without
offence be it spoken) both a cleverer and more respectable man than
many of the characters he represents. Not so when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘O’er the stage the Ghost of Hamlet stalks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Othello rages, Desdemona mourns,</div>
      <div class='line'>And poor Monimia pours her soul in love.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A different feeling then prevails:—close, close the scene upon them,
and never break that fine phantasmagoria of the brain. Or if it must
be done at all, let us chuse some other time and place for it: let no
one wantonly dash the Circean cup from our lips, or dissolve the
spirit of enchantment in the very palace of enchantment. Go, Mr.
—, and sit somewhere else! What a thing it is, for instance, for
any part of an actor’s dress to come off unexpectedly while he is
playing! What a <em>cut</em> it is upon himself and the audience! What
an effort he has to recover himself, and struggle through this exposure
of the naked truth! It has been considered as one of the triumphs
of Garrick’s tragic power, that once, when he was playing Lear, his
crown of straw came off, and nobody laughed or took the least notice,
so much had he identified himself with the character. Was he, after
this, to pay so little respect to the feelings he had inspired, as to tear
off his tattered robes, and take the old, crazed king with him to play
the fool in the boxes?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘No; let him pass. Vex not his parting spirit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor on the rack of this rough world</div>
      <div class='line'>Stretch him out farther!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Some lady is said to have fallen in love with Garrick from being
present when he played the part of Romeo, on which he observed,
that he would undertake to cure her of her folly if she would only
come and see him in Abel Drugger. So the modern tragedian and
fine gentleman, by appearing to advantage, and conspicuously, in
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">propria personâ</span></i>, may easily cure us of our predilection for all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>principal characters he shines in. ‘Sir! do you think Alexander
looked o’ this fashion in his life-time, or was perfumed so? Had
Julius Cæsar such a nose? or wore his frill as you do? You have
slain I don’t know how many heroes “with a bare bodkin,” the gold
pin in your shirt, and spoiled all the fine love speeches you will ever
make by picking your teeth with that inimitable air!’</p>

<p class='c013'>An actor, after having performed his part well, instead of courting
farther distinction, should affect obscurity, and ‘steal most guilty-like
away,’ conscious of admiration that he can support nowhere but in his
proper sphere, and jealous of his own and others’ good opinion of
him, in proportion as he is a darling in the public eye. He cannot
avoid attracting disproportionate attention: why should he wish to
fix it on himself in a perfectly flat and insignificant part, viz. his own
character? It was a bad custom to bring authors on the stage to
crown them. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne ignotum pro magnifico est.</span></i> Even professed critics,
I think, should be shy of putting themselves forward to applaud
loudly: any one in a crowd has ‘a voice potential’ as the press: it
is either committing their pretensions a little indiscreetly, or confirming
their own judgment by a clapping of hands. If you only go and
give the cue lustily, the house seems in wonderful accord with your
opinions. An actor, like a king, should only appear on state
occasions. He loses popularity by too much publicity; or, according
to the proverb, <em>familiarity breeds contempt</em>. Both characters
personate a certain abstract idea, are seen in a fictitious costume,
and when they have ‘shuffled off this more than mortal coil,’ they
had better keep out of the way—the acts and sentiments emanating
from themselves will not carry on the illusion of our prepossessions.
Ordinary transactions do not give scope to grace and dignity like
romantic situations, or prepared pageants, and the <em>little</em> is apt to prevail
over the <em>great</em>, if we come to count the instances.</p>

<p class='c013'>The motto of a great actor should be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aut Cæsar aut nihil</span></i>. I do
not see how with his crown, or plume of feathers, he can get through
those little box-doors without stooping and squeezing his artificial
importance to tatters. The entrance of the stage is arched so high
‘that <em>players</em> may jet through, and keep their gorgeous turbans on,
without good-morrow to the gods!’</p>

<p class='c013'>The top-tragedian of the day has too large and splendid a train
following him to have room for them in one of the dress-boxes.
When he appears there, it should be enlarged express for the
occasion: for at his heels march the figures, in full costume, of Cato,
and Brutus, and Cassius, and of him with the falcon eye, and Othello,
and Lear, and crook-backed Richard, and Hamlet, Prince of Denmark,
and numbers more, and demand entrance along with him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>shadows to which he alone lends bodily substance! ‘The graves
yawn and render up their dead to push us from our stools.’ There
is a mighty bustle at the door, a gibbering and squeaking in the
lobbies. An actor’s retinue is imperial, it presses upon the imagination
too much, and he should therefore slide unnoticed into the pit.
Authors, who are in a manner his makers and masters, sit there
contented—why should not he? ‘He is used to shew himself.’
That then is the very reason he should conceal his person at other
times. A habit of ostentation should not be reduced to a principle.
If I had seen the late Gentleman Lewis fluttering in a prominent
situation in the boxes, I should have been puzzled whether to think
of him as the Copper Captain, or as Bobadil, or Ranger, or young
Rapid, or Lord Foppington, or fifty other whimsical characters:
then I should have got Munden and Quick, and a parcel more of
them in my head, till ‘my brain would have been like a smoke-jack:’
I should not have known what to make of it; but if I had
seen him in the pit, I should merely have eyed him with respectful
curiosity, and have told every one <em>that</em> that was Gentleman Lewis.
We should have concluded from the circumstance that he was a
modest, sensible man: we all knew beforehand that he could show
off whenever he pleased!</p>

<p class='c013'>There is one class of performers that I think is quite exempt from
the foregoing reasoning, I mean <em>retired actors</em>. Come when they will
and where they will, they are welcome to their old friends. They
have as good a right to sit in the boxes as children at the holidays.
But they do not, somehow, come often. It is but a melancholy
recollection with them:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—‘Then sweet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now sad to think on!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Garrick still goes often, and hears the applause of her husband
over again in the shouts of the pit. Had Mrs. Pritchard or Mrs.
Clive been living, I am afraid we should have seen little of them—it
would have been too <em>home</em> a feeling with them. Mrs. Siddons
seldom if ever goes, and yet she is almost the only thing left worth
seeing there. She need not stay away on account of any theory that
I can form. She is out of the pale of all theories, and annihilates all
rules. Wherever she sits there is grace and grandeur, there is tragedy
personified. Her seat is the undivided throne of the Tragic Muse.
She had no need of the robes, the sweeping train, the ornaments of
the stage; in herself she is as great as any being she ever represented
in the ripeness and plenitude of her power! I should not, I confess,
have had the same paramount abstracted feeling at seeing John Kemble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>there, whom I venerate at a distance, and should not have known
whether he was playing off the great man or the great actor:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A little more than kin, and less than kind.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>I know it may be said in answer to all this pretext of keeping the
character of the player inviolate—‘What is there more common, in
fact, than for the hero of a tragedy to speak the prologue, or than for
the heroine, who has been stabbed or poisoned, to revive, and come
forward laughing in the epilogue?’ As to the epilogue, it is spoken
to get rid of the idea of the tragedy altogether, and to ward off the
fury of the pit, who may be bent on its damnation. The greatest
incongruity you can hit upon is, therefore, the most proper for this
purpose. But I deny that the hero of a tragedy, or the principal
character in it, is ever pitched upon to deliver the prologue. It is
always, by prescription, some walking-shadow, some poor player, who
cannot even spoil a part of any consequence. Is there not Mr.
C— always at hand for this purpose, whom the late king pronounced
three times to be ‘a bad actor?’<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a> What is there in common
between that accustomed wave of the hand, and the cocked hat under
the arm, and any passion or person that can be brought forward on
the stage? It is not that we can be said to acquire a prejudice
against so harmless an actor as Mr. C—; we are born with a
prejudice against a speaker of prologues. It is an innate idea: a
natural instinct: there is a particular organ in the brain provided for
it. Do we not all hate a manager? It is not because he is insolent
or impertinent, or fond of making ridiculous speeches, or a notorious
puffer, or ignorant, or mean, or vain, but it is because we see him in
a coat, waistcoat, and breeches. The stage is the world of fantasy:
it is Queen Mab that has invited us to her revels there, and all that
have to do with it should wear motley!</p>

<p class='c013'>Lastly, there are some actors by profession, whose faces we like to
see in the boxes or any where else; but it is because they are no actors,
but rather gentlemen and scholars, and in their proper places in the
boxes, or wherever they are. Does not an actor himself, I would ask,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>feel conscious and awkward in the boxes, if he thinks that he is known?
And does he not sit there in spite of this uneasy feeling, and run the
gauntlet of impertinent looks and whispers, only to get a little by—admiration,
as he thinks? It is hardly to be supposed that he comes to
see the play, the show. He must have enough of plays and finery.
But he wants to see a favourite (perhaps a rival) actor in a striking
part. Then the place for him to do this is the pit. Painters, I
know, always get as close up to a picture they want to copy as they
can; and I should imagine actors would want to do the same, in
order to look into the texture and mechanism of their art. Even
theatrical critics can make nothing of a part that they see from the
boxes. If you sit in the stage-box, your attention is drawn off by
the company and other circumstances. If you get to a distance (so
as to be out of the reach of notice) you can neither hear nor see well.
For myself, I would as soon take a seat on the top of the Monument
to give an account of a first appearance, as go into the second or
third tier of boxes to do it. I went, but the other day, with a boxticket,
to see Miss Fanny Brunton come out in Juliet, and Mr.
Macready make a first appearance in Romeo; and though I was
told (by a tolerable judge) that the new Juliet was the most elegant
figure on the stage, and that Mr. Macready’s Romeo was quite
beautiful, I vow to God I knew nothing of it. So little could I tell
of the matter, that at one time I mistook Mr. Horrebow for Mr.
Abbott. I have seen Mr. Kean play Sir Giles Overreach one night
from the front of the pit, and a few nights after from the front boxes,
facing the stage. It was another thing altogether. That which had
been so lately nothing but flesh and blood, a living fibre, ‘instinct
with fire’ and spirit, was no better than a little fantoccini figure,
darting backwards and forwards on the stage, starting, screaming, and
playing a number of fantastic tricks before the audience. I could
account, in the latter instance, for the little approbation of the performance
manifested around me, and also for the general scepticism with
respect to Mr. Kean’s acting, which has been said to prevail among
those who cannot condescend to go into the pit, and have not interest
in the orchestra—to see him act. They may then stay away altogether.
His face is the running comment on his acting, which reconciles the
audience to it. Without that index to his mind, you are not prepared
for the vehemence and suddenness of his gestures; his pauses are long,
abrupt, and unaccountable, if not filled up by the expression; it is in
the working of his face that you see the writhing and coiling up of the
passions before they make their serpent-spring; the lightning of his
eye precedes the hoarse burst of thunder from his voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>One may go into the boxes, indeed, and criticise acting and actors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>with Sterne’s stop-watch, but no otherwise—‘“And between the
nominative case and the verb (which, as your lordship knows, should
agree together in number, person etc.) there was a full pause of a
second and two thirds.” “But was the eye silent—did the look say
nothing?”—“I looked only at the stop-watch, my lord.”
“Excellent critic!”’—If any other actor, indeed, goes to see
Mr. Kean act, with a view <em>to avoid imitation</em>, this may be the place,
or rather it is the way to run into it, for you see only his extravagances
and defects, which are the most easily carried away. Mr. Matthews
may translate him into an <span class='sc'>At Home</span> even from the <em>slips!</em>—Distinguished
actors then ought, I conceive, to set the example of
going into the pit, were it only for their own sakes. I remember a
trifling circumstance, which I worked up at the time into a confirmation
of this theory of mine, engrafted on old prejudice and
tradition.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a> I had got into the middle of the pit, at considerable risk
of broken bones, to see Mr. Kean in one of his early parts, when I
perceived two young men seated a little behind me, with a certain
space left round them. They were dressed in the height of the
fashion, in light drab-coloured great coats, and with their shirt-sleeves
drawn down over their hands, at a time when this was not so common
as it has since become. I took them for younger sons of some old
family at least. One of them, that was very good-looking, I thought
might be Lord Byron, and his companion might be Mr. Hobhouse.
They seemed to have wandered from another sphere of this our planet
to witness a masterly performance to the utmost advantage. This
stamped the thing. They were, undoubtedly, young men of rank
and fashion; but their taste was greater than their regard for appearances.
The pit was, after all, the true resort of thorough-bred critics
and amateurs. When there was any thing worth seeing, this was the
place; and I began to feel a sort of reflected importance in the
consciousness that I also was a critic. Nobody sat near them—it
would have seemed like an intrusion. Not a syllable was uttered.—They
were two clerks in the Victualling Office!</p>

<p class='c013'>What I would insist on, then, is this—that for Mr. Kean, or
Mr. Young, or Mr. Macready, or any of those that are ‘cried out
upon in the top of the compass’ to obtrude themselves voluntarily or
ostentatiously upon our notice, when they are <em>out of character</em>, is a
solecism in theatricals. For them to thrust themselves forward
before the scenes, is to drag us behind them against our will, than
which nothing can be more fatal to a true passion for the stage, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>which is a privilege that should be kept sacred for impertinent
curiosity. Oh! while I live, let me not be admitted (under special
favour) to an actor’s dressing-room. Let me not see how Cato
painted, or how Cæsar combed! Let me not meet the prompt-boys
in the passage, nor see the half-lighted candles stuck against the bare
walls, nor hear the creaking of machines, or the fiddlers laughing;
nor see a Columbine practising a pirouette in sober sadness, nor
Mr. Grimaldi’s face drop from mirth to sudden melancholy as he
passes the side-scene, as if a shadow crossed it, nor witness the long-chinned
generation of the pantomime sit twirling their thumbs, nor
overlook the fellow who holds the candle for the moon in the scene
between Lorenzo and Jessica! Spare me this insight into secrets I
am not bound to know. The stage is not a mistress that we are
sworn to undress. Why should we look behind the glass of fashion?
Why should we prick the bubble that reflects the world, and turn it
to a little soap and water? Trust a little to first appearances—leave
something to fancy. I observe that the great puppets of the real
stage, who themselves play a grand part, like to get into the boxes
over the stage; where they see nothing from the proper point of view,
but peep and pry into what is going on like a magpie looking into a
marrow-bone. This is just like them. So they look down upon
human life, of which they are ignorant. They see the exits and
entrances of the players, something that they suspect is meant to be
kept from them (for they think they are always liable to be imposed
upon): the petty pageant of an hour ends with each scene long before
the catastrophe, and the tragedy of life is turned to farce under their
eyes. These people laugh loud at a pantomime, and are delighted
with clowns and pantaloons. They pay no attention to any thing
else. The stage-boxes exist in contempt of the stage and common
sense. The private boxes, on the contrary, should be reserved as
the receptacle for the officers of state and great diplomatic characters,
who wish to avoid, rather than court popular notice!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XXIX<br /> <span class='small'>ON THE DISADVANTAGES OF INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>The chief disadvantage of knowing more and seeing farther than
others, is not to be generally understood. A man is, in consequence
of this, liable to start paradoxes, which immediately transport him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>beyond the reach of the common-place reader. A person speaking
once in a slighting manner of a very original-minded man, received
for answer—‘He strides on so far before you, that he dwindles in
the distance!’</p>

<p class='c013'>Petrarch complains, that ‘Nature had made him different from
other people’—<i><span lang="ca" xml:lang="ca">singular’ d’altra genti</span></i>. The great happiness of life
is, to be neither better nor worse than the general run of those you
meet with. If you are beneath them, you are trampled upon; if you
are above them, you soon find a mortifying level in their indifference
to what you particularly pique yourself upon. What is the use of
being moral in a night-cellar, or wise in Bedlam? ‘To be honest,
as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.’ So
says Shakespear; and the commentators have not added that, under
these circumstances, a man is more likely to become the butt of
slander than the mark of admiration for being so. ‘How now, thou
particular fellow<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a>?’ is the common answer to all such out-of-the-way
pretensions. By not doing as those at Rome do, we cut ourselves off
from good-fellowship and society. We speak another language, have
notions of our own, and are treated as of a different species. Nothing
can be more awkward than to intrude with any such far-fetched ideas
among the common herd, who will be sure to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>—‘Stand all astonied, like a sort of steers,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Mongst whom some beast of strange and foreign race</div>
      <div class='line'>Unwares is chanced, far straying from his peers:</div>
      <div class='line'>So will their ghastly gaze betray their hidden fears.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Ignorance of another’s meaning is a sufficient cause of fear, and
fear produces hatred: hence the suspicion and rancour entertained
against all those who set up for greater refinement and wisdom than
their neighbours. It is in vain to think of softening down this spirit
of hostility by simplicity of manners, or by condescending to persons
of low estate. The more you condescend, the more they will presume
upon it; they will fear you less, but hate you more; and will
be the more determined to take their revenge on you for a superiority
as to which they are entirely in the dark, and of which you yourself
seem to entertain considerable doubts. All the humility in the world
will only pass for weakness and folly. They have no notion of such
a thing. They always put their best foot forward; and argue that
you would do the same if you had any such wonderful talents as
people say. You had better, therefore, play off the great man at
once—hector, swagger, talk big, and ride the high horse over them:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>you may by this means extort outward respect or common civility;
but you will get nothing (with low people) by forbearance and good-nature
but open insult or silent contempt. C— always talks to
people about what they don’t understand: I, for one, endeavour to
talk to them about what they do understand, and find I only get the
more ill-will by it. They conceive I do not think them capable of
any thing better; that I do not think it worth while, as the vulgar
saying is, to <em>throw a word to a dog</em>. I once complained of this to
C—, thinking it hard I should be sent to Coventry for not making
a prodigious display. He said, ‘As you assume a certain character,
you ought to produce your credentials. It is a tax upon people’s
good-nature to admit superiority of any kind, even where there is the
most evident proof of it: but it is too hard a task for the imagination
to admit it without any apparent ground at all.’</p>

<p class='c013'>There is not a greater error than to suppose that you avoid the
envy, malice, and uncharitableness, so common in the world, by going
among people without pretensions. There are no people who have
no pretensions; or the fewer their pretensions, the less they can afford
to acknowledge yours without some sort of value received. The
more information individuals possess, or the more they have refined
upon any subject, the more readily can they conceive and admit the
same kind of superiority to themselves that they feel over others.
But from the low, dull, level sink of ignorance and vulgarity, no idea
or love of excellence can arise. You think you are doing mighty
well with them; that you are laying aside the buckram of pedantry
and pretence, and getting the character of a plain, unassuming, good
sort of fellow. It will not do. All the while that you are making
these familiar advances, and wanting to be at your ease, they are
trying to recover the wind of you. You may forget that you are
an author, an artist, or what not—they do not forget that they are
nothing, nor bate one jot of their desire to prove you in the same
predicament. They take hold of some circumstance in your dress;
your manner of entering a room is different from that of other
people; you do not eat vegetables—that’s odd; you have a
particular phrase, which they repeat, and this becomes a sort of
standing joke; you look grave, or ill; you talk, or are more silent
than usual; you are in or out of pocket: all these petty, inconsiderable
circumstances, in which you resemble, or are unlike other people,
form so many counts in the indictment which is going on in their
imaginations against you, and are so many contradictions in your
character. In any one else they would pass unnoticed, but in a
person of whom they had heard so much, they cannot make them out
at all. Meanwhile, those things in which you may really excel, go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>for nothing, because they cannot judge of them. They speak highly
of some book which you do not like, and therefore you make no
answer. You recommend them to go and see some picture, in
which they do not find much to admire. How are you to convince
them that you are right? Can you make them perceive that the
fault is in them, and not in the picture, unless you could give them
your knowledge? They hardly distinguish the difference between
a Correggio and a common daub. Does this bring you any nearer to
an understanding? The more you know of the difference, the more
deeply you feel it, or the more earnestly you wish to convey it,
the farther do you find yourself removed to an immeasurable distance
from the possibility of making them enter into views and feelings of
which they have not even the first rudiments. You cannot make
them see with your eyes, and they must judge for themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Intellectual is not like bodily strength. You have no hold of the
understanding of others but by their sympathy. Your knowing, in
fact, so much more about a subject does not give you a superiority,
that is, a power over them, but only renders it the more impossible
for you to make the least impression on them. Is it then an
advantage to you? It may be, as it relates to your own private
satisfaction, but it places a greater gulf between you and society. It
throws stumbling blocks in your way at every turn. All that you
take most pride and pleasure in is lost upon the vulgar eye. What
they are pleased with is a matter of indifference or of distaste to you.
In seeing a number of persons turn over a portfolio of prints from
different masters, what a trial it is to the patience, how it jars the
nerves to hear them fall into raptures at some common-place flimsy
thing, and pass over some divine expression of countenance without
notice, or with a remark that it is very singular-looking? How
useless is it in such cases to fret or argue, or remonstrate? Is it not
quite as well to be without all this hypercritical, fastidious knowledge,
and to be pleased or displeased as it happens, or struck with the first
fault or beauty that is pointed out by others? I would be glad
almost to change my acquaintance with pictures, with books, and,
certainly, what I know of mankind, for any body’s ignorance of
them!</p>

<p class='c013'>It is recorded in the life of some worthy (whose name I forget)
that he was one of those ‘who loved hospitality and respect:’ and I
profess to belong to the same classification of mankind. Civility is
with me a jewel. I like a little comfortable cheer, and careless,
indolent, chat. I hate to be always wise, or aiming at wisdom. I
have enough to do with literary cabals, questions, critics, actors,
essay-writing, without taking them out with me for recreation, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>into all companies. I wish at these times to pass for a good-humoured
fellow; and good-will is all I ask in return to make good
company. I do not desire to be always posing myself or others with
the questions of fate, free-will, fore-knowledge absolute, &amp;c. I must
unbend sometimes. I must occasionally lie fallow. The kind of
conversation that I affect most is what sort of a day it is, and whether
it is likely to rain or hold up fine for to-morrow. This I consider
as enjoying the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">otium cum dignitate</span></i>, as the end and privilege of a life
of study. I would resign myself to this state of easy indifference,
but I find I cannot. I must maintain a certain pretension, which is
far enough from my wish. I must be put on my defence, I must
take up the gauntlet continually, or I find I lose ground. ‘I am
nothing, if not critical.’ While I am thinking what o’clock it is,
or how I came to blunder in quoting a well-known passage, as if I
had done it on purpose, others are thinking whether I am not
really as dull a fellow as I am sometimes said to be. If a
drizzling shower patters against the windows, it puts me in mind
of a mild spring rain, from which I retired twenty years ago,
into a little public house near Wem in Shropshire, and while I
saw the plants and shrubs before the door imbibe the dewy moisture,
quaffed a glass of sparkling ale, and walked home in the dusk of
evening, brighter to me than noon-day suns at present are! Would
I indulge this feeling? In vain. They ask me what news there
is, and stare if I say I don’t know. If a new actress has come
out, why must I have seen her? If a new novel has appeared, why
must I have read it? I, at one time, used to go and take a hand at
cribbage with a friend, and afterwards discuss a cold sirloin of beef,
and throw out a few lack-a-daisical remarks, in a way to please
myself, but it would not do long. I set up little pretension, and
therefore the little that I did set up was taken from me. As I said
nothing on that subject myself, it was continually thrown in my teeth
that I was <em>an author</em>. From having me at this disadvantage, my
friend wanted to peg on a hole or two in the game, and was displeased
if I would not let him. If I won of him, it was hard he should be
beat by an author. If he won, it would be strange if he did not
understand the game better than I did. If I mentioned my favourite
game of rackets, there was a general silence, as if this was my weak
point. If I complained of being ill, it was asked why I made myself
so? If I said such an actor had played a part well, the answer was,
there was a different account in one of the newspapers. If any
allusion was made to men of letters, there was a suppressed smile.
If I told a humorous story, it was difficult to say whether the laugh
was at me or at the narrative. The wife hated me for my ugly face:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the servants because I could not always get them tickets for the play,
and because they could not tell exactly what an author meant. If a
paragraph appeared against any thing I had written, I found it was
ready there before me, and I was to undergo a regular <em>roasting</em>. I
submitted to all this till I was tired, and then I gave it up.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the miseries of intellectual pretensions is, that nine-tenths
of those you come in contact with do not know whether you are an
impostor or not. I dread that certain anonymous criticisms should get
into the hands of servants where I go, or that my hatter or shoemaker
should happen to read them, who cannot possibly tell whether they
are well or ill founded. The ignorance of the world leaves one at
the mercy of its malice. There are people whose good opinion or
good will you want, setting aside all literary pretensions; and it is
hard to lose by an ill report (which you have no means of rectifying)
what you cannot gain by a good one. After a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diatribe</span></i> in the —,
(which is taken in by a gentleman who occupies my old apartments
on the first floor) my landlord brings me up his bill (of some standing),
and on my offering to give him so much in money, and a note of
hand for the rest, shakes his head, and says, he is afraid he could
make no use of it. Soon after, the daughter comes in, and on my
mentioning the circumstance carelessly to her, replies gravely, ‘that
indeed her father has been almost ruined by bills.’ <em>This is the
unkindest cut of all.</em> It is in vain for me to endeavour to explain that
the publication in which I am abused is a mere government engine—an
organ of a political faction. They know nothing about that.
They only know such and such imputations are thrown out; and the
more I try to remove them, the more they think there is some truth
in them. Perhaps the people of the house are strong Tories—government-agents
of some sort. Is it for me to enlighten their
ignorance? If I say, I once wrote a thing called Prince Maurice’s
Parrot, and an Essay on the Regal Character, in the former of which
allusion is made to a noble marquis, and in the latter to a great
personage (so at least, I am told, it has been construed), and that Mr.
Croker has peremptory instructions to retaliate; they cannot conceive
what connection there can be between me and such distinguished
characters. I can get no farther. Such is the misery of pretensions
beyond your situation, and which are not backed by any external
symbols of wealth or rank, intelligible to all mankind!</p>

<p class='c013'>The impertinence of admiration is scarcely more tolerable than the
demonstrations of contempt. I have known a person, whom I had
never seen before, besiege me all dinner-time with asking, what articles
I had written in the Edinburgh Review? I was at last ashamed to
answer to my splendid sins in that way. Others will pick out something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>not yours, and say, they are sure no one else could write it.
By the first sentence they can always tell your style. Now I hate
my style to be known; as I hate all <em>idiosyncrasy</em>. These obsequious
flatterers could not pay me a worse compliment. Then there are
those who make a point of reading every thing you write (which is
fulsome); while others, more provoking, regularly lend your works
to a friend as soon as they receive them. They pretty well know
your notions on the different subjects, from having heard you talk
about them. Besides, they have a greater value for your personal
character than they have for your writings. You explain things better
in a common way, when you are not aiming at effect. Others tell you
of the faults they have heard found with your last book, and that they
defend your style in general from a charge of obscurity. A friend
once told me of a quarrel he had had with a near relation, who
denied that I knew how to spell the commonest words. These are
comfortable confidential communications, to which authors, who have
their friends and excusers, are subject. A gentleman told me, that a
lady had objected to my use of the word <em>learneder</em>, as bad grammar.
He said, that he thought it a pity that I did not take more care, but
that the lady was perhaps prejudiced, as her husband held a government-office.
I looked for the word, and found it in a motto from
Butler. I was piqued, and desired him to tell the fair critic, that the
fault was not in me, but in one who had far more wit, more learning,
and loyalty than I could pretend to. Then, again, some will pick
out the flattest thing of yours they can find, to load it with panegyrics;
and others tell you (by way of letting you see how high they
rank your capacity), that your best passages are failures. L—
has a knack of tasting (or as he would say, <em>palating</em>) the insipid:
L. H. has a trick of turning away from the relishing morsels you
put on his plate. There is no getting the start of some people. Do
what you will, they can do it better; meet with what success you
may, their own good opinion stands them in better stead, and runs
before the applause of the world. I once shewed a person of this
over-weening turn (with no small triumph I confess) a letter of a very
flattering description I had received from the celebrated Count
Stendhal, dated Rome. He returned it with a smile of indifference,
and said, he had had a letter from Rome himself the day before, from
his friend S—! I did not think this ‘germane to the matter.’
G—dw—n pretends I never wrote any thing worth a farthing but
my answers to Vetus, and that I fail altogether when I attempt to
write an essay, or any thing in a short compass.</p>

<p class='c013'>What can one do in such cases? Shall I confess a weakness?
The only set-off I know to these rebuffs and mortifications, is sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>in an accidental notice or involuntary mark of distinction from
a stranger. I feel the force of Horace’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">digito monstrari</span></i>—I like to
be pointed out in the street, or to hear people ask in Mr. Powell’s
court, <em>which is Mr. H—?</em> This is to me a pleasing extension of
one’s personal identity. Your name so repeated leaves an echo like
music on the ear: is stirs the blood like the sound of a trumpet. It
shews that other people are curious to see you: that they think of
you, and feel an interest in you without your knowing it. This is a
bolster to lean upon; a lining to your poor, shivering, thread-bare
opinion of yourself. You want some such cordial to exhausted
spirits, and relief to the dreariness of abstract speculation. You are
something; and, from occupying a place in the thoughts of others,
think less contemptuously of yourself. You are the better able to
run the gauntlet of prejudice and vulgar abuse. It is pleasant in this
way to have your opinion quoted against yourself, and your own
sayings repeated to you as good things. I was once talking with an
intelligent man in the pit, and criticising Mr. Knight’s performance
of Filch. ‘Ah!’ he said, ‘little Simmons was the fellow to play
that character.’ He added, ‘There was a most excellent remark made
upon his acting it in the <span class='sc'>Examiner</span> (I think it was)—<em>That he looked
as if he had the gallows in one eye and a pretty girl in the other.</em>’ I said
nothing, but was in remarkably good humour the rest of the evening.
I have seldom been in a company where fives-playing has been talked
of, but some one has asked, in the course of it, ‘Pray did any one
ever see an account of one Cavanagh, that appeared some time back
in most of the papers? Is it known who wrote it?’ These are
trying moments. I had a triumph over a person, whose name I will
not mention, on the following occasion. I happened to be saying
something about Burke, and was expressing my opinion of his talents
in no measured terms, when this gentleman interrupted me by saying,
he thought, for his part, that Burke had been greatly overrated, and
then added, in a careless way, ‘Pray did you read a character of him
in the last number of the — —?’ ‘I wrote it!’—I could not
resist the antithesis, but was afterwards ashamed of my momentary
petulance. Yet no one, that I find, ever spares me.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some persons seek out and obtrude themselves on public characters,
in order, as it might seem, to pick out their failings, and afterwards
betray them. Appearances are for it, but truth and a better knowledge
of nature are against this interpretation of the matter. Sycophants
and flatterers are undesignedly treacherous and fickle. They are prone
to admire inordinately at first, and not finding a constant supply of
food for this kind of sickly appetite, take a distaste to the object of
their idolatry. To be even with themselves for their credulity, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>sharpen their wits to spy out faults, and are delighted to find that this
answers better than their first employment. It is a course of study,
‘lively, audible, and full of vent.’ They have the organ of wonder and
the organ of fear in a prominent degree. The first requires new objects
of admiration to satisfy its uneasy cravings: the second makes them
crouch to power wherever its shifting standard appears, and willing
to curry favour with all parties, and ready to betray any out of sheer
weakness and servility. I do not think they mean any harm. At
least, I can look at this obliquity with indifference in my own
particular case. I have been more disposed to resent it as I have
seen it practised upon others, where I have been better able to judge
of the extent of the mischief, and the heartlessness and idiot folly
it discovered.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not think great intellectual attainments are any recommendation
to the women. They puzzle them, and are a diversion to the
main question. If scholars talk to ladies of what they understand,
their hearers are none the wiser: if they talk of other things, they
only prove themselves fools. The conversation between Angelica
and Foresight, in Love for Love, is a receipt in full for all such
overstrained nonsense: while he is wandering among the signs of
the zodiac, she is standing a tip-toe on the earth. It has been remarked
that poets do not choose mistresses very wisely. I believe
it is not choice, but necessity. If they could throw the handkerchief
like the Grand Turk, I imagine we should see scarce mortals, but
rather goddesses, surrounding their steps, and each exclaiming, with
Lord Byron’s own Ionian maid—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘So shalt thou find me ever at thy side,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here and hereafter, if the last may be!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Ah! no, these are bespoke, carried off by men of mortal, not
ethereal mould, and thenceforth the poet, from whose mind the ideas
of love and beauty are inseparable as dreams from sleep, goes on
the forlorn hope of the passion, and dresses up the first Dulcinea
that will take compassion on him, in all the colours of fancy. What
boots it to complain if the delusion lasts for life, and the rainbow
still paints its form in the cloud?</p>

<p class='c013'>There is one mistake I would wish, if possible, to correct. Men
of letters, artists, and others, not succeeding with women in a certain
rank of life, think the objection is to their want of fortune, and that
they shall stand a better chance by descending lower, where only
their good qualities or talents will be thought of. Oh! worse and
worse. The objection is to themselves, not to their fortune—to
their abstraction, to their absence of mind, to their unintelligible and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>romantic notions. Women of education may have a glimpse of their
meaning, may get a clue to their character, but to all others they are
thick darkness. If the mistress smiles at their <em>ideal</em> advances, the
maid will laugh outright; she will throw water over you, get her
little sister to listen, send her sweetheart to ask you what you mean,
will set the village or the house upon your back; it will be a farce,
a comedy, a standing jest for a year, and then the murder will out.
Scholars should be sworn at Highgate. They are no match for
chamber maids, or wenches at lodging-houses. They had better try
their hands on heiresses or ladies of quality. These last have high
notions of themselves that may fit some of your epithets! They are
above mortality, so are your thoughts! But with low life, trick,
ignorance, and cunning, you have nothing in common. Whoever
you are, that think you can make a compromise or a conquest there
by good nature, or good sense, be warned by a friendly voice, and
retreat in time from the unequal contest.</p>

<p class='c013'>If, as I have said above, scholars are no match for chambermaids,
on the other hand, gentlemen are no match for blackguards. The
former are on their honour, act on the square; the latter take all
advantages, and have no idea of any other principle. It is astonishing
how soon a fellow without education will learn to cheat. He is
impervious to any ray of liberal knowledge; his understanding is</p>

<p class='c015'>but it is porous to all sorts of tricks, chicanery, stratagems, and
knavery, by which any thing is to be got. Mrs. Peachum, indeed,
says, that ‘to succeed at the gaming-table, the candidate should have
the education of a nobleman.’ I do not know how far this example
contradicts my theory. I think it is a rule that men in business
should not be taught other things. Any one will be almost sure to
make money who has no other idea in his head. A college-education,
or intense study of abstract truth, will not enable a man
to drive a bargain, to over-reach another, or even to guard himself
from being over-reached. As Shakespear says, that ‘to have a good
face is the effect of study, but reading and writing come by nature:’
so it might be argued, that to be a knave is the gift of fortune, but
to play the fool to advantage it is necessary to be a learned man.
The best politicians are not those who are deeply grounded in
mathematical or in ethical science. Rules stand in the way of expediency.
Many a man has been hindered from pushing his fortune
in the world by an early cultivation of his moral sense, and has repented
of it at leisure during the rest of his life. A shrewd man
said of my father, that he would not send a son of his to school to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>him on any account, for that by teaching him to speak the truth, he
would disqualify him from getting his living in the world!</p>

<p class='c013'>It is hardly necessary to add any illustration to prove that the
most original and profound thinkers are not always the most successful
or popular writers. This is not merely a temporary disadvantage;
but many great philosophers have not only been scouted while they
were living, but forgotten as soon as they were dead. The name of
Hobbes is perhaps sufficient to explain this assertion. But I do not
wish to go farther into this part of the subject, which is obvious in
itself. I have said, I believe, enough to take off the air of paradox
which hangs over the title of this Essay.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XXX<br /> <span class='small'>ON PATRONAGE AND PUFFING</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>‘A gentle husher, Vanity by name.’—<span class='sc'>Spenser.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>A lady was complaining to a friend of mine of the credulity of
people in attending to quack advertisements, and wondering who
could be taken in by them—‘for that she had never bought but one
half-guinea bottle of Dr. ——’s Elixir of Life, and it had done
her no sort of good!’ This anecdote seemed to explain pretty well
what made it worth the doctor’s while to advertise his wares in every
newspaper in the kingdom. He would no doubt be satisfied if every
delicate, sceptical invalid, in his majesty’s dominions, gave his Elixir
one trial, merely to show the absurdity of the thing. We affect to
laugh at the folly of those who put faith in nostrums, but are willing
to see ourselves whether there is any truth in them.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a strong tendency in the human mind to flatter itself with
secret hopes, with some lucky reservation in our own favour, though
reason may point out the grossness of the trick in general; and,
besides, there is a wonderful power in words, formed into regular
propositions, and printed in capital letters, to draw the assent after
them, till we have proof of their fallacy. The ignorant and idle
believe what they read, as Scotch philosophers demonstrate the
existence of a material world, and other learned propositions, from
the evidence of their senses. The ocular proof is all that is wanting
in either case. As hypocrisy is said to be the highest compliment
to virtue, the art of lying is the strongest acknowledgment of the
force of truth. We can hardly <em>believe</em> a thing to be a lie, though we
<em>know</em> it to be so. The ‘puff direct,’ even as it stands in the columns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>of the Times newspaper, branded with the title of Advertisement
before it, claims some sort of attention and respect for the merits
that it discloses, though we think the candidate for public favour
and support has hit upon (perhaps) an injudicious way of laying them
before the world. Still there may be something in them; and even
the outrageous improbability and extravagance of the statement on
the very face of it, stagger us, leave a hankering to inquire farther
into it, because we think the advertiser would hardly have the
impudence to hazard such barefaced absurdities without some foundation.
Such is the strength of the association between words and
things in the mind—so much oftener must our credulity have been
justified by the event than imposed upon. If every second story
we heard was an invention, we should lose our mechanical disposition
to trust to the meaning of sounds, just as when we have met with a
number of counterfeit pieces of coin, we suspect good ones; but our
implicit assent to what we hear is a proof how much more sincerity
and good faith there is in the sum total of our dealings with one
another, than artifice and imposture.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘To elevate and surprise’ is the great art of quackery and puffing;
to raise a lively and exaggerated image in the mind, and take it by
surprise before it can recover breath, as it were; so that by having
been caught in the trap, it is unwilling to retract entirely—has a
secret desire to find itself in the right, and a determination to see
whether it is or not. Describe a picture as <em>lofty</em>, <em>imposing</em>, and
<em>grand</em>, these words excite certain ideas in the mind like the sound
of a trumpet, which are not to be quelled, except by seeing the
picture itself, nor even then if it is viewed by the help of a catalogue,
written expressly for the occasion by the artist himself. It is not to
be supposed that <em>he</em> would say such things of his picture, unless they
were allowed by all the world; and he repeats them, on this gentle
understanding, till all the world allows them.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a> So reputation runs
in a vicious circle, and merit limps behind it, mortified and abashed
at its own insignificance. It has been said that the test of fame or
popularity is to consider the number of times your name is repeated
by others, or is brought to their recollection in the course of a year.
At this rate, a man has his reputation in his own hands, and by the
help of puffing and the press, may forestall the voice of posterity, and
stun the ‘groundling’ ear of his contemporaries. A name let off in
your hearing continually, with some bouncing epithet affixed to it,
startles you like the report of a pistol close at your ear: you cannot
help the effect upon the imagination, though you know it is perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>harmless—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox et præterea nihil</span></i>. So, if you see the same name staring
you in the face in great letters, at the corner of every street, you
involuntarily think the owner of it must be a great man to occupy
so large a space in the eye of the town. The appeal is made, in the
first instance, to the senses, but it sinks below the surface into the
mind. There are some, indeed, who publish their own disgrace,
and make their names a common by-word and nuisance, notoriety
being all that they want. A quack gets himself surreptitiously
dubbed Doctor or Knight; and though you may laugh in his face,
it pays expenses. Parolles and his drum typify many a modern
adventurer, and court-candidate, for unearned laurels and unblushing
honours. Of all puffs, lottery-puffs are the most ingenious and most
innocent. A collection of them would make an amusing <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vade mecum</span></i>.
They are still various and the same, with that infinite <em>ruse</em> with which
they lull the reader at the outset out of all suspicion, the insinuating
turn in the middle, the home-thrust at the ruling passion at last, by
which your spare cash is conjured clean out of the pocket in spite
of resolution, by the same stale, well-known, thousandth-time repeated,
artifice of <em>All prizes</em> and <em>No blanks</em>—a self-evident imposition!
Nothing, however, can be a stronger proof of the power of fascinating
the public judgment through the eye alone. I know a gentleman
who amassed a considerable fortune (so as to be able to keep his
carriage) by printing nothing but lottery placards and hand-bills of
a colossal size. Another friend of mine (of no mean talents) was
applied to (as a snug thing in the way of business) to write regular
lottery-puffs for a large house in the city, and on having a parcel of
samples returned on his hands as done in too severe and terse a style,
complained quaintly enough, ‘<em>That modest merit never could succeed!</em>’
Even Lord Byron, as he tells us, has been accused of writing lottery-puffs.
There are various ways of playing one’s self off before the
public, and keeping one’s name alive. The newspapers, the lamp-posts,
the walls of empty houses, the shutters of windows, the blank
covers of magazines and reviews, are open to every one. I have
heard of a man of literary celebrity sitting in his study writing letters
of remonstrance to himself, on the gross defects of a plan of education
he had just published, and which remained unsold on the bookseller’s
counter. Another feigned himself dead in order to see what
would be said of him in the newspapers, and to excite a sensation in
this way. A flashy pamphlet has been run to a five-and-thirtieth
edition, and thus ensured the writer a ‘deathless date’ among political
charlatans, by regularly striking off a new title-page to every fifty or
a hundred copies that were sold. This is a vile practice. It is an
erroneous idea got abroad (and which I will contradict here) that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>paragraphs are paid for in the leading Journals. It is quite out of
the question. A favourable notice of an author, an actress, &amp;c. may
be inserted through interest or to oblige a friend, but it must invariably
be done for <em>love</em>, not <em>money</em>!</p>

<p class='c013'>When I formerly had to do with these sort of critical verdicts,
I was generally sent out of the way when any <em>debutant</em> had a friend
at court, and was to be tenderly handled. For the rest, or those of
robust constitutions, I had <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</span></i> given me. Sometimes I ran
out of the course, to be sure. Poor Perry! what bitter complaints
he used to make, that by <em>running-a-muck</em> at lords and Scotchmen I
should not leave him a place to dine out at! The expression of his
face at these moments, as if he should shortly be without a friend
in the world, was truly pitiable. What squabbles we used to have
about Kean and Miss Stephens, the only theatrical favourites I ever
had! Mrs. Billington had got some notion that Miss Stephens
would never make a singer, and it was the torment of Perry’s life
(as he told me in confidence) that he could not get any two people
to be of the same opinion on any one point. I shall not easily forget
bringing him my account of her first appearance in the Beggar’s
Opera. I have reason to remember that article: it was almost the
last I ever wrote with any pleasure to myself. I had been down on
a visit to my friends near Chertsey, and, on my return, had stopped
at an inn at Kingston-upon-Thames, where I had got the Beggar’s
Opera, and had read it over-night. The next day I walked cheerfully
to town. It was a fine sunny morning, in the end of autumn,
and as I repeated the beautiful song, ‘Life knows no return of spring,’
I meditated my next day’s criticism, trying to do all the justice I
could to so inviting a subject. I was not a little proud of it by
anticipation. I had just then begun to stammer out my sentiments
on paper, and was in a kind of honey-moon of authorship. But soon
after, my final hopes of happiness, and of human liberty, were blighted
nearly at the same time; and since then I have had no pleasure in
any thing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And Love himself can flatter me no more.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It was not so ten years since (ten short years since.—Ah! how fast
those years run that hurry us away from our last fond dream of
bliss!) when I loitered along thy green retreats, oh! Twickenham,
and conned over (with enthusiastic delight) the chequered view,
which one of thy favourites drew of human life! I deposited my
account of the play at the Morning Chronicle Office in the afternoon,
and went to see Miss Stephens as Polly. Those were happy times,
in which she first came out in this character, in Mandane, where she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>sang the delicious air, ‘If o’er the cruel tyrant, Love,’ (so as it can
never be sung again), in Love in a Village, where the scene opened
with her and Miss Matthews in a painted garden of roses and honeysuckles,
and ‘Hope, thou nurse of young Desire,’ thrilled from two
sweet voices in turn. Oh! may my ears sometimes still drink the
same sweet sounds, embalmed with the spirit of youth, of health, and
joy, but in the thoughts of an instant, but in a dream of fancy, and I
shall hardly need to complain! When I got back, after the play,
Perry called out, with his cordial, grating voice, ‘Well, how did she
do?’ and on my speaking in high terms, answered, that ‘he had
been to dine with his friend the Duke, that some conversation had
passed on the subject, he was afraid it was not the thing, it was not
the true <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">sostenuto</span></i> style; but as I had written the article’ (holding
my peroration on the Beggar’s Opera carelessly in his hand) ‘it
might pass!’ I could perceive that the rogue licked his lips at it,
and had already in imagination ‘bought golden opinions of all sorts of
people’ by this very criticism, and I had the satisfaction the next
day to meet Miss Stephens coming out of the Editor’s room, who
had been to thank him for his very flattering account of her.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was sent to see Kean the first night of his performance in
Shylock, when there were about a hundred people in the pit, but
from his masterly and spirited delivery of the first striking speech,
‘On such a day you called me dog,’ &amp;c. I perceived it was a
hollow thing. So it was given out in the Chronicle, but Perry was
continually at me as other people were at him, and was afraid it
would not last. It was to no purpose I said <em>it would last</em>: yet I am
in the right hitherto. It has been said, ridiculously, that Mr. Kean
was written up in the Chronicle. I beg leave to state my opinion
that no actor can be written up or down by a paper. An author may
be puffed into notice, or damned by criticism, because his book may
not have been read. An artist may be overrated, or undeservedly
decried, because the public is not much accustomed to see or judge of
pictures. But an actor is judged by his peers, the play-going public,
and must stand or fall by his own merits or defects. The critic may
give the tone or have a casting voice where popular opinion is divided;
but he can no more <em>force</em> that opinion either way, or wrest it from its
base in common-sense and feeling, than he can move Stonehenge.
Mr. Kean had, however, physical disadvantages and strong prejudices
to encounter, and so far the <em>liberal</em> and <em>independent</em> part of the press
might have been of service in helping him to his seat in the public
favour. May he long keep it with dignity and firmness!<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>It was pretended by the Covent-garden people, and some others at
the time, that Mr. Kean’s popularity was a mere effect of love of
novelty, a nine days’ wonder, like the rage after Master Betty’s
acting, and would be as soon over. The comparison did not hold.
Master Betty’s acting was so far wonderful, and drew crowds to see
it as a mere singularity, because he was a boy. Mr. Kean was a
grown man, and there was no rule or precedent established in the
ordinary course of nature why some other man should not appear
in tragedy as great as John Kemble. Farther, Master Betty’s acting
was a singular phenomenon, but it was also as beautiful as it was
singular. I saw him in the part of Douglas, and he seemed almost
like ‘some gay creature of the element,’ moving about gracefully,
with all the flexibility of youth, and murmuring Æolian sounds with
plaintive tenderness. I shall never forget the way in which he
repeated the line in which Young Norval says, speaking of the fate
of two brothers:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And in my mind happy was he that died!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The tones fell and seemed to linger prophetic on my ear. Perhaps
the wonder was made greater than it was. Boys at that age can
often read remarkably well, and certainly are not without natural
grace and sweetness of voice. The Westminster school-boys are a
better company of comedians than we find at most of our theatres.
As to the understanding a part like Douglas, at least, I see no
difficulty on that score. I myself used to recite the speech in
Enfield’s Speaker with good emphasis and discretion when at school,
and entered, about the same age, into the wild sweetness of the
sentiments in Mrs. Radcliffe’s Romance of the Forest, I am sure,
quite as much as I should do now. Yet the same experiment has
been often tried since, and has uniformly failed.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>It was soon after this that Coleridge returned from Italy, and he
got one day into a long <em>tirade</em> to explain what a ridiculous farce the
whole was, and how all the people abroad were shocked at the
<em>gullibility</em> of the English nation, who on this and every other occasion
were open to the artifices of all sorts of quacks, wondering how any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>persons with the smallest pretensions to common sense could for a
moment suppose that a boy could act the characters of men without
any of their knowledge, their experience, or their passions. We
made some faint resistance, but in vain. The discourse then took a
turn, and Coleridge began a laboured eulogy on some promising youth,
the son of an English artist, whom he had met in Italy, and who had
wandered all over the Campagna with him, whose talents, he assured
us, were the admiration of all Rome, and whose early designs had
almost all the grace and purity of Raphael’s. At last, some one
interrupted the endless theme by saying a little impatiently, ‘Why
just now you would not let us believe our own eyes and ears about
young Betty, because you have a theory against premature talents, and
now you start a boy phenomenon, that nobody knows any thing about
but yourself—a young artist that, you tell us, is to rival Raphael!’ The
truth is, we like to have something to admire ourselves, as well as to
make other people gape and stare at; but then it must be a discovery
of our own, an idol of our own making and setting up:—if others
stumble on the discovery before us, or join in crying it up to the skies,
we then set to work to prove that this is a vulgar delusion, and show
our sagacity and freedom from prejudice by pulling it in pieces with
all the coolness imaginable. Whether we blow the bubble or crush
it in our hands, vanity and the desire of empty distinction are equally
at the bottom of our sanguine credulity or fastidious scepticism.
There are some who always fall in with the fashionable prejudice
as others affect singularity of opinion on all such points, according
as they think they have more or less wit to judge for themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>If a little varnishing and daubing, a little puffing and quacking, and
giving yourself a good name, and getting a friend to speak a word for
you, is excusable in any profession, it is, I think, in that of painting.
Painting is an occult science, and requires a little ostentation and
mock-gravity in the professor. A man may here rival Katterfelto,
‘with his hair on end at his own wonders, wondering for his bread;’
for, if he does not, he may in the end go without it. He may ride
on a high trotting horse, in green spectacles, and attract notice to his
person any how he can, if he only works hard at his profession. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>‘it only is when he is <em>out</em> he is acting,’ let him make the fools stare,
but give others something worth looking at. Good Mr. Carver and
Gilder, good Mr. Printer’s Devil, good Mr. Bill-sticker, ‘do me
your offices’ unmolested! Painting is a plain ground, and requires a
great many heraldic quarterings and facings to set it off. Lay on,
and do not spare. No man’s merit can be fairly judged of, if he is
not known; and how can he be known, if he keeps entirely in the
back ground?<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a> A great name in art goes but a little way, is chilled
as it creeps along the surface of the world, without something to
revive and make it blaze out with fresh splendor. Fame is here
almost obscurity. It is long before your name affixed to a sterling
design will be spelt out by an undiscerning, regardless public. Have
it proclaimed, therefore, as a necessary precaution, by sound of
trumpet at the corners of the street, let it be stuck as a label in your
mouth, carry it on a placard at your back. Otherwise, the world
will never trouble themselves about you, or will very soon forget you.
A celebrated artist of the present day, whose name is engraved at the
bottom of some of the most touching specimens of English art, once
had a frame-maker call on him, who, on entering his room, exclaimed
with some surprise, ‘What, are you a painter, sir?’ The other
made answer, a little startled in his turn, ‘Why, didn’t you know
that? Did you never see my name at the bottom of prints?’ He
could not recollect that he had. ‘And yet you sell picture-frames
and prints?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘What painters’ names then did he recollect:
Did he know West’s?’ ‘Oh! yes.’ ‘And Opie’s?’ ‘Yes.’
‘And Fuseli’s?’ ‘Oh! yes.’ ‘But you never heard of me?’
‘I cannot say that I ever did!’ It was plain, from this conversation,
that Mr. N— had not kept company enough with picture-dealers
and newspaper critics. On another occasion, a country-gentleman,
who was sitting to him for his portrait, asked him if he had any
pictures in the Exhibition at Somerset-house, and on his replying
in the affirmative, desired to know what they were. He mentioned
among others, ‘The Marriage of Two Children;’ on which the
gentleman expressed great surprise, and said that was the very
picture his wife was always teasing him to go and have another
look at, though he had never noticed the painter’s name. When
the public are so eager to be amused, and care so little who it is
that amuses them, it is not amiss to remind them of it now and
then; or even to have a starling taught to repeat the name, to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>they owe such misprized obligations, in their drowsy ears. On any
other principle, I cannot conceive how painters (not without genius
or industry) can fling themselves at the head of the public in the
manner they do, having lives written of themselves, busts made of
themselves, prints stuck in the shop-windows of themselves, and
their names placed in ‘the first row of the rubric,’ with those of
Rubens, Raphael, and Michael Angelo, swearing by themselves or
their proxies that these glorified spirits would do well to leave the
abodes of the blest in order to stand in mute wonder and with uplifted
hands before some production of theirs, which is yet hardly
dry! Oh! whatever you do, leave that string untouched. It will
jar the rash and unhallowed hand that meddles with it. Profane
not the mighty dead by mixing them up with the uncanonized living.
Leave yourself a reversion in immortality, beyond the noisy clamour
of the day. Do not quite lose your respect for public opinion by
making it in all cases a palpable cheat, the echo of your own lungs
that are hoarse with calling on the world to admire. Do not think
to bully posterity, or to cozen your contemporaries. Be not always
anticipating the effect of your picture on the town—think more
about deserving success than commanding it. In issuing so many
promissory notes upon the bank of fame, do not forget you have
to pay in sterling gold. Believe that there is something in the
pursuit of high art, beyond the manufacture of a paragraph or
the collection of receipts at the door of an exhibition. Venerate
art as art. Study the works of others, and inquire into those of
nature. Gaze at beauty. Become great by great efforts, and not
by pompous pretensions. Do not think the world was blind to
merit before your time, nor make the reputation of great geniuses
the stalking horse to your vanity. You have done enough to insure
yourself attention: you have now only to do something to deserve
it, and to make good all that you have aspired to do!</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a silent and systematic assumption of superiority which
is as barefaced and unprincipled an imposture as the most impudent
puffing. You may, by a tacit or avowed censure on all other arts,
on all works of art, on all other pretensions, tastes, talents, but your
own, produce a complete ostracism in the world of intellect, and
leave yourself and your own performances alone standing, a mighty
monument in an universal waste and wreck of genius. By cutting
away the rude block and removing the rubbish from around it, the
idol may be effectually exposed to view, placed on its pedestal of
pride, without any other assistance. This method is more inexcusable
than the other. For there is no egotism or vanity so
hateful as that which strikes at our satisfaction in every thing else,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>and derives its nourishment from preying, like the vampyre, on the
carcase of others’ reputation. I would rather, in a word, that a
man should talk for ever of himself with vapid senseless assurance,
than preserve a malignant, heartless silence, when the merit of a
rival is mentioned. I have seen instances of both, and can judge
pretty well between them.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no great harm in putting forward one’s own pretensions
(of whatever kind) if this does not bear a sour, malignant aspect
towards others. Every one sets himself off to the best advantage
he can, and tries to steal a march upon public opinion. In this
sense, too, ‘all the world’s a stage, and all the men and women
merely players.’ Life itself is a piece of harmless quackery. A
great house over your head is of no use but to announce the great
man within. Dress, equipage, title, livery-servants, are only so
many quack advertisements and assumptions of the question of
merit. The star that glitters at the breast would be worth nothing
but as a badge of personal distinction; and the crown itself is but
a symbol of the virtues, which the possessor inherits from a long
line of illustrious ancestors! How much honour and honesty have
been forfeited to be graced with a title or a ribbon; how much
genius and worth have sunk to the grave, without an escutcheon and
without an epitaph!</p>

<p class='c013'>As men of rank and fortune keep lacqueys to reinforce their
claims to self-respect, so men of genius sometimes surround themselves
with a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coterie</span></i> of admirers to increase their reputation with
the public. These <em>proneurs</em>, or satellites, repeat all their good
things, laugh loud at all their jokes, and remember all their oracular
decrees. They are their shadows and echoes. They talk of them
in all companies, and bring back word of all that has been said
about them. They hawk the good qualities of their patrons, as
shopmen and <em>barkers</em> tease you to buy goods. I have no notion
of this vanity at second-hand; nor can I see how this servile
testimony from inferiors (‘some followers of mine own’) can be
a proof of merit. It may soothe the ear; but that it should impose
on the understanding, I own surprises me: yet there are persons
who cannot exist without a <em>cortege</em> of this kind about them, in which
they smiling read the opinion of the world, in the midst of all sorts
of rancorous abuse and hostility, as Otho called for his mirror in
the Illyrian field. One good thing is, that this evil, in some degree,
cures itself; and when a man has been nearly ruined by a herd
of these sycophants, he finds them leaving him, like thriftless
dependents for some more eligible situation, carrying away with them
all the tattle they can pick up, and some left-off suit of finery. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>same proneness to adulation which made them lick the dust before
one idol, makes them bow as low to the rising Sun; they are as
lavish of detraction as they were prurient with praise; and the
<em>protegé</em> and admirer of the editor of the — figures in Blackwood’s
train. The man is a lacquey, and it is of little consequence whose
livery he wears!</p>

<p class='c013'>I would advise those who volunteer the office of puffing, to go
the whole length of it. No half-measures will do. Lay it on
thick and three-fold, or not at all. If you are once harnessed into
that vehicle, it will be in vain for you to think of stopping. You
must drive to the devil at once. The mighty Tamburlaine, to whose
car you are yoked, cries out,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Holloa, you pamper’d jades of Asia,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can you not drive but twenty miles a day?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He has you on the hip, for you have pledged your taste and
judgment to his genius. Never fear but he will drive this wedge.
If you are once screwed into such a machine, you must extricate
yourself by main force. No hyperboles are too much: any drawback,
any admiration on this side idolatry, is high treason. It is
an unpardonable offence to say that the last production of your
patron is not so good as the one before it; or that a performer
shines more in one character than another. I remember once
hearing a player declare that he never looked into any newspapers
or magazines on account of the abuse that was always levelled at
himself in them, though there were not less than three persons in
company, who made it their business through these conduit pipes
of fame to ‘cry him up to the top of the compass.’ This sort of
expectation is a little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exigeante</span></i>!</p>

<p class='c013'>One fashionable mode of acquiring reputation is by patronising
it. This may be from various motives, real good nature, good
taste, vanity, or pride. I shall only speak of the spurious ones in
this place. The quack and the <em>would-be</em> patron are well met.
The house of the latter is a sort of curiosity-shop or <em>menagerie</em>,
where all sort of intellectual pretenders and grotesques, musical
children, arithmetical prodigies, occult philosophers, lecturers, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">accoucheurs</span></i>,
apes, chemists, fiddlers, and buffoons are to be seen for
the asking, and are shown to the company for nothing. The folding-doors
are thrown open, and display a collection that the world
cannot parallel again. There may be a few persons of common
sense and established reputation, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rari nantes in gurgite vasto</span></i>, otherwise
it is a mere scramble or lottery. The professed encourager of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">virtù</span></i>
and letters, being disappointed of the great names, sends out into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>the highways for the halt, the lame, and the blind, for all who
pretend to distinction, defects, and obliquities, for all the disposable
vanity or affectation floating on the town, in hopes that, among so
many oddities, chance may bring some jewel or treasure to his
door, which he may have the good fortune to appropriate in some
way to his own use, or the credit of displaying to others. The
art is to encourage rising genius—to bring forward doubtful and
unnoticed merit. You thus get a set of novices and raw pretenders
about you, whose actual productions do not interfere with your
self-love, and whose future efforts may reflect credit on your
singular sagacity and faculty for finding out talent in the germ; and
in the next place, by having them completely in your power, you
are at liberty to dismiss them whenever you will, and to supply the
deficiency by a new set of wondering, unwashed faces, in a rapid
succession; an ‘aiery of children,’ embryo actors, artists, poets, or
philosophers. Like unfledged birds they are hatched, nursed, and
fed by hand; this gives room for a vast deal of management, meddling,
care, and condescending solicitude, but the instant the callow brood
are fledged, they are driven from the nest, and forced to shift for
themselves in the wide world. One sterling production decides the
question between them and their patrons, and from that time they
become the property of the public. Thus a succession of importunate,
hungry, idle, over-weening candidates for fame, are encouraged by
these fickle keepers, only to be betrayed, and left to starve or beg, or
pine in obscurity, while the man of merit and respectability is neglected,
discountenanced, and stigmatised, because he will not lend himself as
a tool to this system of splendid imposition, or pamper the luxury and
weaknesses of the Vulgar Great. When a young artist is too independent
to subscribe to the dogmas of his superiors, or fulfils their
predictions and prognostics of wonderful contingent talent too soon,
so as to get out of leading strings, and lean on public opinion for
partial support, exceptions are taken to his dress, dialect, or manners,
and he is expelled the circle with a character for ingratitude and
treachery. None can procure toleration long but those who do not
contradict the opinions, or excite the jealousy of their betters. One
independent step is an appeal from them to the public, their natural
and hated rivals, and annuls the contract between them, which implies
ostentatious countenance on the one part, and servile submission on
the other. But enough of this.</p>

<p class='c013'>The patronage of men of talent, even when it proceeds from vanity,
is often carried on with a spirit of generosity and magnificence, as
long as these are in difficulties and a state of dependence: but as the
principle of action in this case is a love of power, the complacency in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>the object of friendly regard ceases with the opportunity or necessity
for the same manifest display of power; and when the unfortunate
<em>protegé</em> is just coming to land, and expects a last helping hand, he is, to
his surprise, pushed back, in order that he may be saved from drowning
once more. You are not hailed ashore, as you had supposed, by
these kind friends, as a mutual triumph after all your struggles and their
exertions in your behalf. It is a piece of presumption in you to be
seen walking on <em>terra-firma</em>: you are required, at the risk of their
friendship, to be always swimming in troubled waters, that they may
have the credit of throwing out ropes, and sending out life-boats to you,
without ever bringing you ashore. Your successes, your reputation,
which you think would please them, as justifying their good opinion,
are coldly received, and looked at askance, because they remove
your dependence on them: if you are under a cloud, they do all
they can to keep you there by their good-will: they are so sensible
of your gratitude that they wish your obligations never to cease, and
take care you shall owe no one else a good turn; and provided you
are compelled or contented to remain always in poverty, obscurity,
and disgrace, they will continue your very good friends and humble
servants to command, to the end of the chapter. The tenure of these
indentures is hard. Such persons will wilfully forfeit the gratitude
created by years of friendship, by refusing to perform the last act of
kindness that is likely ever to be demanded of them: will lend you
money, if you have no chance of repaying them; will give you their
good word, if nobody will believe it; and the only thing they do
not forgive is an attempt or probability on your part, of being able to
repay your obligations. There is something disinterested in all this:
at least, it does not show a cowardly or mercenary disposition, but it
savours too much of arrogance and arbitrary pretension. It throws
a damning light on this question to consider who are mostly the
subjects of the patronage of the great, and in the habit of receiving
cards of invitation to splendid dinners. I confess, for one, I am not
on the list; at which I do not grieve much, nor wonder at all.
Authors, in general, are not in much request. Dr. Johnson was
asked why he was not more frequently invited out; and he said,
‘Because great lords and ladies do not like to have their mouths stopped.’
Garrick was not in this predicament: he could amuse the company
in the drawing-room by imitating the great moralist and lexicographer,
and make the negro boy, in the court-yard, die with laughing to see
him take off the swelling airs and strut of the turkey-cock. This was
clever and amusing, but it did not involve an opinion, it did not lead
to a difference of sentiment, in which the owner of the house might
be found in the wrong. Players, singers, dancers, are hand and glove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>with the great. They embellish, and have an <em>eclat</em> in their names,
but do not come into collision. Eminent portrait-painters, again, are
tolerated, because they come into personal contact with the great:
and sculptors hold equality with lords when they have a certain
quantity of solid marble in their workshops to answer for the solidity
of their pretensions. People of fashion and property must have
something to show for their patronage, something visible or tangible.
A sentiment is a visionary thing; an argument may lead to dangerous
consequences, and those who are likely to broach either one or the
other, are not, therefore, fit for good company in general. Poets,
and men of genius, who find their way there, soon find their way out.
They are not of <em>that ilk</em>, with some exceptions. Painters who come
in contact with majesty get on by servility or buffoonery, by letting
themselves down in some way. Sir Joshua was never a favourite at
court. He kept too much at a distance. Beechey gained a vast deal
of favour by familiarity, and lost it by taking too great freedoms.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a>
West ingratiated himself in the same quarter by means of practices as
little creditable to himself as his august employer, namely, by playing
the hypocrite, and professing sentiments the reverse of those he
naturally felt. Kings (I know not how justly) have been said to be
lovers of low company, and low conversation. They are also said to
be fond of dirty practical jokes. If the fact is so, the reason is as
follows. From the elevation of their rank, aided by pride and
flattery, they look down on the rest of mankind, and would not be
thought to have all their advantages for nothing. They wish to
maintain the same precedence in private life that belongs to them as
a matter of outward ceremony. This pretension they cannot keep up
by fair means; for in wit or argument they are not superior to the
common run of men. They therefore answer a repartee by a
practical joke, which turns the laugh against others, and cannot be
retaliated with safety. This is, they avail themselves of the privilege
of their situation to take liberties, and degrade those about them, as
they can only keep up the idea of their own dignity by proportionably
lowering their company.</p>

  <h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XXXI<br /> <span class='small'>ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHARACTER</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is astonishing, with all our opportunities and practice, how little
we know of this subject. For myself, I feel that the more I learn,
the less I understand it.</p>

<p class='c013'>I remember, several years ago, a conversation in the <em>Diligence</em>
coming from Paris, in which, on its being mentioned that a man had
married his wife after thirteen years’ courtship, a fellow-countryman
of mine observed, that ‘then, at least, he would be acquainted with
her character;’ when a Monsieur P—, inventor and proprietor of
the <em>Invisible Girl</em>, made answer, ‘No, not at all; for that the very
next day she might turn out the very reverse of the character that she
had appeared in during all the preceding time.’<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a> I could not help
admiring the superior sagacity of the French juggler, and it struck
me then that we could never be sure when we had got at the bottom
of this riddle.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are various ways of getting at a knowledge of character—by
looks, words, actions. The first of these, which seems the most
superficial, is perhaps the safest, and least liable to deceive: nay, it is
that which mankind, in spite of their pretending to the contrary,
most generally go by. Professions pass for nothing, and actions may
be counterfeited: but a man cannot help his looks. ‘Speech,’ said
a celebrated wit, ‘was given to man to conceal his thoughts.’ Yet
I do not know that the greatest hypocrites are the least silent. The
mouth of Cromwell is pursed up in the portraits of him, as if he was
afraid to trust himself with words. Lord Chesterfield advises us, if
we wish to know the real sentiments of the person we are conversing
with, to look in his face, for he can more easily command his words
than his features. A man’s whole life may be a lie to himself and
others: and yet a picture painted of him by a great artist would
probably stamp his true character on the canvas, and betray the secret
to posterity. Men’s opinions were divided, in their life-times, about
such prominent personages as Charles <span class='fss'>V.</span> and Ignatius Loyola, partly,
no doubt, from passion and interest, but partly from contradictory
evidence in their ostensible conduct: the spectator, who has ever
seen their pictures by Titian, judges of them at once, and truly.
I had rather leave a good portrait of myself behind me than have a
fine epitaph. The face, for the most part, tells what we have thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>and felt—the rest is nothing. I have a higher idea of Donne from a
rude, half-effaced outline of him prefixed to his poems than from any
thing he ever wrote. Cæsar’s Commentaries would not have redeemed
him in my opinion, if the bust of him had resembled the Duke of
—. My old friend, Fawcett, used to say, that if Sir Isaac
Newton himself had lisped, he could not have thought any thing of
him. So I cannot persuade myself that any one is a great man, who
looks like a fool. In this I may be wrong.</p>

<p class='c013'>First impressions are often the truest, as we find (not unfrequently)
to our cost, when we have been wheedled out of them by plausible
professions or actions. A man’s look is the work of years, it is
stamped on his countenance by the events of his whole life, nay,
more, by the hand of nature, and it is not to be got rid of easily.
There is, as it has been remarked repeatedly, something in a person’s
appearance at first sight which we do not like, and that gives us an
odd twinge, but which is overlooked in a multiplicity of other circumstances,
till the mask is taken off, and we see this lurking character
verified in the plainest manner in the sequel. We are struck at first,
and by chance, with what is peculiar and characteristic; also with
permanent <em>traits</em> and general effect: this afterwards goes off in a set
of unmeaning, common-place details. This sort of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i>
evidence then, shows what a man is, better than what he says or
does; for it shows us the habit of his mind, which is the same under
all circumstances and disguises. You will say, on the other hand,
that there is no judging by appearances, as a general rule. No one,
for instance, would take such a person for a very clever man, without
knowing who he was. Then, ten to one, he is not; he may have
got the reputation, but it is a mistake. You say, there is Mr. —,
undoubtedly a person of great genius: yet, except when excited by
something extraordinary, he seems half dead. He has wit at will,
yet wants life and spirit. He is capable of the most generous acts,
yet meanness seems to cling to every motion. He looks like a poor
creature—and in truth he is one! The first impression he gives you
of him answers nearly to the feeling he has of his personal identity;
and this image of himself, rising from his thoughts, and shrouding his
faculties, is that which sits with him in the house, walks out with him
into the street, and haunts his bed-side. The best part of his existence
is dull, cloudy, leaden: the flashes of light that proceed from it, or
streak it here and there, may dazzle others, but do not deceive
himself. Modesty is the lowest of the virtues, and is a real confession
of the deficiency it indicates. He who undervalues himself is justly
undervalued by others. Whatever good properties he may possess
are, in fact, neutralised by a ‘cold rheum’ running through his veins,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>and taking away the zest of his pretensions, the pith and marrow of
his performances. What is it to me that I can write these <span class='sc'>Table-talks</span>?
It is true I can, by a reluctant effort, rake up a parcel of
half-forgotten observations, but they do not float on the surface of
my mind, nor stir it with any sense of pleasure, nor even of pride.
Others have more property in them than I have: <em>they</em> may reap the
benefit, <em>I</em> have only had the pain. Otherwise, they are to me as if
they had never existed: nor should I know that I had ever thought
at all, but that I am reminded of it by the strangeness of my
appearance, and my unfitness for every thing else. Look in C—’s
face while he is talking. His words are such as might ‘create a
soul under the ribs of death.’ His face is a blank. Which are
we to consider as the true index of his mind? Pain, languor,
shadowy remembrances, are the uneasy inmates there: his lips move
mechanically!</p>

<p class='c013'>There are people that we do not like, though we may have known
them long, and have no fault to find with them, ‘their appearance, as
we say, is so much against them.’ That is not all, if we could find
it out. There is, generally, a reason for this prejudice; for nature
is true to itself. They may be very good sort of people, too, in their
way, but still something is the matter. There is a coldness, a
selfishness, a levity, an insincerity, which we cannot fix upon any
particular phrase or action, but we see it in their whole persons and
deportment. One reason that we do not see it in any other way
may be, that they are all the time trying to conceal this defect by
every means in their power. There is, luckily, a sort of <em>second sight</em>
in morals: we discern the lurking indications of temper and habit a
long while before their palpable effects appear. I once used to meet
with a person at an ordinary, a very civil, good-looking man in other
respects, but with an odd look about his eyes, which I could not
explain, as if he saw you under their fringed lids, and you could not
see him again: this man was a common sharper. The greatest
hypocrite I ever knew was a little, demure, pretty, modest-looking
girl, with eyes timidly cast upon the ground, and an air soft as
enchantment; the only circumstance that could lead to a suspicion of
her true character was a cold, sullen, watery, glazed look about the
eyes, which she bent on vacancy, as if determined to avoid all
explanation with yours. I might have spied in their glittering,
motionless surface, the rocks and quicksands that awaited me below!
We do not feel quite at ease in the company or friendship of those
who have any natural obliquity or imperfection of person. The
reason is, they are not on the best terms with themselves, and are
sometimes apt to play off on others the tricks that nature has played
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>them. This, however, is a remark that, perhaps, ought not to have
been made. I know a person to whom it has been objected as a
disqualification for friendship, that he never shakes you cordially by
the hand. I own this is a damper to sanguine and florid temperaments,
who abound in these practical demonstrations and ‘compliments
extern.’ The same person, who testifies the least pleasure at meeting
you, is the last to quit his seat in your company, grapples with a
subject in conversation right earnestly, and is, I take it, backward to
give up a cause or a friend. Cold and distant in appearance, he
piques himself on being the king of <em>good haters</em>, and a no less zealous
partisan. The most phlegmatic constitutions often contain the most
inflammable spirits—as fire is struck from the hardest flints.</p>

<p class='c013'>And this is another reason that makes it difficult to judge of
character. Extremes meet; and qualities display themselves by the
most contradictory appearances. Any inclination, in consequence of
being generally suppressed, vents itself the more violently when an
opportunity presents itself: the greatest grossness sometimes accompanies
the greatest refinement, as a natural relief, one to the other;
and we find the most reserved and indifferent tempers at the
beginning of an entertainment, or an acquaintance, turn out the most
communicative and cordial at the end of it. Some spirits exhaust
themselves at first: others gain strength by progression. Some minds
have a greater facility of throwing off impressions, are, as it were, more
transparent or porous than others. Thus the French present a marked
contrast to the English in this respect. A Frenchman addresses you
at once with a sort of lively indifference: an Englishman is more
on his guard, feels his way, and is either exceedingly reserved, or
lets you into his whole confidence, which he cannot so well impart to
an entire stranger. Again, a Frenchman is naturally humane: an
Englishman is, I should say, only friendly by habit. His virtues and
his vices cost him more than they do his more gay and volatile
neighbours. An Englishman is said to speak his mind more plainly
than others:—yes, if it will give you pain to hear it. He does not
care whom he offends by his discourse: a foreigner generally strives
to oblige in what he says. The French are accused of promising
more than they perform. That may be, and yet they may perform
as many good-natured acts as the English, if the latter are as averse
to perform as they are to promise. Even the professions of the
French may be sincere at the time, or arise out of the impulse of the
moment; though their desire to serve you may be neither very
violent nor very lasting. I cannot think, notwithstanding, that the
French are not a serious people; nay, that they are not a more
reflecting people than the common run of the English. Let those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>who think them merely light and mercurial, explain that enigma,
their everlasting prosing tragedy. The English are considered as
comparatively a slow, plodding people. If the French are quicker,
they are also more plodding. See, for example, how highly
finished and elaborate their works of art are! How systematic
and correct they aim at being in all their productions of a
graver cast! ‘If the French have a fault,’ as Yorick said, ‘it is
that they are too grave.’ With wit, sense, cheerfulness, patience,
good-nature and refinement of manners, all they want is imagination
and sturdiness of moral principle! Such are some of the contradictions
in the character of the two nations, and so little does the
character of either appear to have been understood! Nothing can
be more ridiculous indeed than the way in which we exaggerate each
other’s vices and extenuate our own. The whole is an affair of
prejudice on one side of the question, and of partiality on the other.
Travellers who set out to carry back a true report of the case appear
to lose not only the use of their understandings, but of their senses,
the instant they set foot in a foreign land. The commonest facts and
appearances are distorted, and discoloured. They go abroad with
certain preconceived notions on the subject, and they make every
thing answer, in reason’s spite, to their favourite theory. In addition
to the difficulty of explaining customs and manners foreign to our own,
there are all the obstacles of wilful prepossession thrown in the way.
It is not, therefore, much to be wondered at that nations have
arrived at so little knowledge of one another’s characters; and that,
where the object has been to widen the breach between them, any
slight differences that occur are easily blown into a blaze of fury by
repeated misrepresentations, and all the exaggerations that malice or
folly can invent!</p>

<p class='c013'>This ignorance of character is not confined to foreign nations: we
are ignorant of that of our own countrymen in a class a little below or
above ourselves. We shall hardly pretend to pronounce magisterially
on the good or bad qualities of strangers; and, at the same time, we
are ignorant of those of our friends, of our kindred, and of our own.
We are in all these cases either too near or too far off the object to
judge of it properly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Persons, for instance, in a higher or middle rank of life know
little or nothing of the characters of those below them, as servants,
country people, &amp;c. I would lay it down in the first place as a
general rule on this subject, that all uneducated people are hypocrites.
Their sole business is to deceive. They conceive themselves in a
state of hostility with others, and stratagems are fair in war. The
inmates of the kitchen and the parlour are always (as far as respects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>their feeling and intentions towards each other) in Hobbes’s ‘state of
nature.’ Servants and others in that line of life have nothing to
exercise their spare talents for invention upon but those about them.
Their superfluous electrical particles of wit and fancy are not carried
off by those established and fashionable conductors, novels and
romances. Their faculties are not buried in books, but all alive and
stirring, erect and bristling like a cat’s back. Their coarse conversation
sparkles with ‘wild wit, invention ever new.’ Their
betters try all they can to set themselves up above them, and they
try all they can to pull them down to their own level. They do
this by getting up a little comic interlude, a daily, domestic, homely
drama out of the odds and ends of the family failings, of which there
is in general a pretty plentiful supply, or make up the deficiency of
materials out of their own heads. They turn the qualities of their
masters and mistresses inside out, and any real kindness or condescension
only sets them the more against you. They are not to be
taken in in that way—they will not be baulked in the spite they have
to you. They only set to work with redoubled alacrity, to lessen
the favour or to blacken your character. They feel themselves like a
degraded <em>caste</em>, and cannot understand how the obligations can be all
on one side, and the advantages all on the other. You cannot come
to equal terms with them—they reject all such overtures as insidious
and hollow—nor can you ever calculate upon their gratitude or good-will,
any more than if they were so many strolling Gipsies or wild
Indians. They have no fellow-feeling, they keep no faith with the
more privileged classes. They are in your power, and they
endeavour to be even with you by trick and cunning, by lying and
chicanery. In this they have nothing to restrain them. Their
whole life is a succession of shifts, excuses, and expedients. The
love of truth is a principle with those only who have made it their
study, who have applied themselves to the pursuit of some art or
science, where the intellect is severely tasked, and learns by habit to
take a pride in, and to set a just value on, the correctness of its
conclusions. To have a disinterested regard to truth, the mind must
have contemplated it in abstract and remote questions; whereas the
ignorant and vulgar are only conversant with those things in which
their own interest is concerned. All their notions are local, personal,
and consequently gross and selfish. They say whatever comes
uppermost—turn whatever happens to their own account—and invent
any story, or give any answer that suits their purposes. Instead of
being bigoted to general principles, they trump up any lie for the
occasion, and the more of a <em>thumper</em> it is, the better they like it; the
more unlooked-for it is, why, so much the more of a <em>God-send</em>!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>They have no conscience about the matter; and if you find them out
in any of their manœuvres, are not ashamed of themselves, but angry
with you. If you remonstrate with them, they laugh in your face.
The only hold you have of them is their interest—you can but
dismiss them from your employment; and <em>service is no inheritance</em>.
If they affect any thing like decent remorse, and hope you will pass
it over, all the while they are probably trying to recover the wind of
you. Persons of liberal knowledge or sentiments have no kind of
chance in this sort of mixed intercourse with these barbarians in
civilised life. You cannot tell, by any signs or principles, what is
passing in their minds. There is no common point of view between
you. You have not the same topics to refer to, the same language
to express yourself. Your interests, your feelings are quite distinct.
You take certain things for granted as rules of action: they take
nothing for granted but their own ends, pick up all their knowledge
out of their own occasions, are on the watch only for what they can
catch—are</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>They have indeed a regard to their character, as this last may affect
their livelihood or advancement, none as it is connected with a sense
of propriety; and this sets their mother-wit and native talents at work
upon a double file of expedients, to bilk their consciences, and salve
their reputation. In short, you never know where to have them, any
more than if they were of a different species of animals; and in
trusting to them, you are sure to be betrayed and over-reached.
You have other things to mind, they are thinking only of you, and
how to turn you to advantage. <em>Give and take</em> is no maxim here.
You can build nothing on your own moderation or on their false
delicacy. After a familiar conversation with a waiter at a tavern,
you overhear him calling you by some provoking nickname. If you
make a present to the daughter of the house where you lodge, the
mother is sure to recollect some addition to her bill. It is a running
fight. In fact, there is a principle in human nature not willingly to
endure the idea of a superior, a sour jacobinical disposition to wipe out
the score of obligation, or efface the tinsel of external advantages—and
where others have the opportunity of coming in contact with us, they
generally find the means to establish a sufficiently marked degree of
degrading equality. No man is a hero to his valet-de-chambre, is an
old maxim. A new illustration of this principle occurred the other
day. While Mrs. Siddons was giving her readings of Shakespear to
a brilliant and admiring drawing-room, one of the servants in the hall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>below was saying, ‘What, I find the old lady is making as much
noise as ever!’ So little is there in common between the different
classes of society, and so impossible is it ever to unite the diversities
of custom and knowledge which separate them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Women, according to Mrs. Peachum, are ‘bitter bad judges’ of
the characters of men; and men are not much better of theirs, if we
can form any guess from their choice in marriage. Love is proverbially
blind. The whole is an affair of whim and fancy. Certain
it is, that the greatest favourites with the other sex are not those who
are most liked or respected among their own. I never knew but
one clever man who was what is called a <em>lady’s man</em>; and he
(unfortunately for the argument) happened to be a considerable
coxcomb. It was by this irresistible quality, and not by the force of
his genius, that he vanquished. Women seem to doubt their own
judgments in love, and to take the opinion which a man entertains of
his own prowess and accomplishments for granted. The wives of
poets are (for the most part) mere pieces of furniture in the room.
If you speak to them of their husbands’ talents or reputation in the
world, it is as if you made mention of some office that they held.
It can hardly be otherwise, when the instant any subject is started or
conversation arises, in which men are interested, or try one another’s
strength, the women leave the room, or attend to something else.
The qualities then in which men are ambitious to excel, and which
ensure the applause of the world, eloquence, genius, learning, integrity,
are not those which gain the favour of the fair. I must not deny,
however, that wit and courage have this effect. Neither is youth or
beauty the sole passport to their affections.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The way of woman’s will is hard to find,</div>
      <div class='line'>Harder to hit.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Yet there is some clue to this mystery, some determining cause; for
we find that the same men are universal favourites with women, as
others are uniformly disliked by them. Is not the loadstone that
attracts so powerfully, and in all circumstances, a strong and undisguised
bias towards them, a marked attention, a conscious preference
of them to every other passing object or topic? I am not sure, but
I incline to think so. The successful lover is the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cavalier servente</span></i> of
all nations. The man of gallantry behaves as if he had made an
assignation with every woman he addresses. An argument immediately
draws off my attention from the prettiest woman in the room.
I accordingly succeed better in argument—than in love!—I do not
think that what is called <em>Love at first sight</em> is so great an absurdity as
it is sometimes imagined to be. We generally make up our minds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>beforehand to the sort of person we should like, grave or gay, black,
brown, or fair; with golden tresses or with raven locks;—and when
we meet with a complete example of the qualities we admire, the
bargain is soon struck. We have never seen any thing to come up
to our newly discovered goddess before, but she is what we have been
all our lives looking for. The idol we fall down and worship is an
image familiar to our minds. It has been present to our waking
thoughts, it has haunted us in our dreams, like some fairy vision.
Oh! thou, who, the first time I ever beheld thee, didst draw my
soul into the circle of thy heavenly looks, and wave enchantment
round me, do not think thy conquest less complete because it was
instantaneous; for in that gentle form (as if another Imogen had
entered) I saw all that I had ever loved of female grace, modesty,
and sweetness!</p>

<p class='c013'>I shall not say much of friendship as giving an insight into character,
because it is often founded on mutual infirmities and prejudices.
Friendships are frequently taken up on some sudden sympathy,
and we see only as much as we please of one another’s characters
afterwards. Intimate friends are not fair witnesses to character,
any more than professed enemies. They cool, indeed, in time,
part, and retain only a rankling grudge at past errors and oversights.
Their testimony in the latter case is not quite free from
suspicion.</p>

<p class='c013'>One would think that near relations, who live constantly together,
and always have done so, must be pretty well acquainted with one
another’s characters. They are nearly in the dark about it.
Familiarity confounds all traits of distinction: interest and prejudice
take away the power of judging. We have no opinion on the
subject, any more than of one another’s faces. The Penates, the
household-gods, are veiled. We do not see the features of those
we love, nor do we clearly distinguish their virtues or their vices.
We take them as they are found in the lump:—by weight, and not
by measure. We know all about the individuals, their sentiments,
history, manners, words, actions, every thing: but we know all these
too much as facts, as inveterate, habitual impressions, as clothed with
too many associations, as sanctified with too many affections, as woven
too much into the web of our hearts, to be able to pick out the
different threads, to cast up the items of the debtor and creditor
account, or to refer them to any general standard of right and wrong.
Our impressions with respect to them are too strong, too real, too
much <em>sui generis</em>, to be capable of a comparison with any thing but
themselves. We hardly inquire whether those for whom we are
thus interested, and to whom we are thus knit, are <em>better</em> or <em>worse</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>than others—the question is a kind of profanation—all we know is,
they are <em>more</em> to us than any one else can be. Our sentiments of this
kind are rooted and grow in us, and we cannot eradicate them by
voluntary means. Besides, our judgments are bespoke, our interests
take part with our blood. If any doubt arises, if the veil of our
implicit confidence is drawn aside by any accident for a moment, the
shock is too great, like that of a dislocated limb, and we recoil
on our habitual impressions again. Let not that veil ever be rent
entirely asunder, so that those images may be left bare of reverential
awe, and lose their religion: for nothing can ever support the desolation
of the heart afterwards.</p>

<p class='c013'>The greatest misfortune that can happen among relations is a
different way of bringing up, so as to set one another’s opinions and
characters in an entirely new point of view. This often lets in an
unwelcome day-light on the subject, and breeds schisms, coldness,
and incurable heart-burnings in families. I have sometimes thought
whether the progress of society and march of knowledge does not do
more harm in this respect, by loosening the ties of domestic attachment,
and preventing those who are most interested in, and anxious
to think well of one another, from feeling a cordial sympathy and
approbation of each other’s sentiments, manners, views, &amp;c. than it
does good by any real advantage to the community at large. The
son, for instance, is brought up to the church, and nothing can exceed
the pride and pleasure the father takes in him, while all goes on well
in this favourite direction. His notions change, and he imbibes a
taste for the Fine Arts. From this moment there is an end of any
thing like the same unreserved communication between them. The
young man may talk with enthusiasm of his ‘Rembrandts, Correggios,
and stuff:’ it is all <em>Hebrew</em> to the elder; and whatever satisfaction
he may feel in hearing of his son’s progress, or good wishes for his
success, he is never reconciled to the new pursuit, he still hankers
after the first object that he had set his mind upon. Again, the
grandfather is a Calvinist, who never gets the better of his disappointment
at his son’s going over to the Unitarian side of the question.
The matter rests here, till the grandson, some years after, in the
fashion of the day and ‘infinite agitation of men’s wit,’ comes to
doubt certain points in the creed in which he has been brought up,
and the affair is all abroad again. Here are three generations made
uncomfortable and in a manner set at variance, by a veering point of
theology, and the officious meddling biblical critics! Nothing,
on the other hand, can be more wretched or common than that upstart
pride and insolent good fortune which is ashamed of its origin; nor
are there many things more awkward than the situation of rich and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>poor relations. Happy, much happier, are those tribes and people
who are confined to the same <em>caste</em> and way of life from sire to son,
where prejudices are transmitted like instincts, and where the same
unvarying standard of opinion and refinement blends countless generations
in its improgressive, everlasting mould!</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only is there a wilful and habitual blindness in near kindred
to each other’s defects, but an incapacity to judge from the quantity
of materials, from the contradictoriness of the evidence. The chain
of particulars is too long and massy for us to lift it or put it into the
most approved ethical scales. The concrete result does not answer
to any abstract theory, to any logical definition. There is black, and
white, and grey, square and round—there are too many anomalies,
too many redeeming points, in poor human nature, such as it actually
is, for us to arrive at a smart, summary decision on it. We know
too much to come to any hasty or partial conclusion. We do not
pronounce upon the present act, because a hundred others rise up to
contradict it. We suspend our judgments altogether, because in effect
one thing unconsciously balances another; and perhaps this obstinate,
pertinacious indecision would be the truest philosophy in other cases,
where we dispose of the question of character easily, because we have
only the smallest part of the evidence to decide upon. Real character
is not one thing, but a thousand things; actual qualities do not conform
to any factitious standard in the mind, but rest upon their own
truth and nature. The dull stupor under which we labour in respect
of those whom we have the greatest opportunities of inspecting nearly,
we should do well to imitate, before we give extreme and uncharitable
verdicts against those whom we only see in passing, or at a distance.
If we knew them better, we should be disposed to say less about
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the truth of things, there are none utterly worthless, none without
some drawback on their pretensions, or some alloy of imperfection.
It has been observed that a familiarity with the worst characters
lessens our abhorrence of them; and a wonder is often expressed that
the greatest criminals look like other men. The reason is that <em>they
are like other men in many respects</em>. If a particular individual was
merely the wretch we read of, or conceive in the abstract, that is, if
he was the mere personified idea of the criminal brought to the bar,
he would not disappoint the spectator, but would look like what he
would be—a monster! But he has other qualities, ideas, feelings,
nay, probably virtues, mixed up with the most profligate habits or
desperate acts. This need not lessen our abhorrence of the crime,
though it does of the criminal; for it has the latter effect only by
showing him to us in different points of view, in which he appears a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>common mortal, and not the caricature of vice we took him for, or
spotted all over with infamy. I do not at the same time think this
a lax or dangerous, though it is a charitable view of the subject.
In my opinion, no man ever answered in his own mind (except in the
agonies of conscience or of repentance, in which latter case he throws
the imputation from himself in another way) to the abstract idea of
a <em>murderer</em>. He may have killed a man in self-defence, or ‘in the
trade of war,’ or to save himself from starving, or in revenge for an
injury, but always ‘so as with a difference,’ or from mixed and
questionable motives. The individual, in reckoning with himself,
always takes into the account the considerations of time, place, and
circumstance, and never makes out a case of unmitigated, unprovoked
villany, of ‘pure defecated evil’ against himself. There are degrees
in real crimes: we reason and moralise only by names and in classes.
I should be loth, indeed, to say, that ‘whatever is, is right:’ but
almost every actual choice inclines to it, with some sort of imperfect,
unconscious bias. This is the reason, besides the ends of secresy,
of the invention of <em>slang</em> terms for different acts of profligacy committed
by thieves, pickpockets, &amp;c. The common names suggest
associations of disgust in the minds of others, which those who
live by them do not willingly recognise, and which they wish to sink
in a technical phraseology. So there is a story of a fellow who, as
he was writing down his confession of a murder, stopped to ask how
the word <em>murder</em> was spelt; this, if true, was partly because his
imagination was staggered by the recollection of the thing, and partly
because he shrunk from the verbal admission of it. ‘<em>Amen</em> stuck in
his throat!’ The defence made by Eugene Aram of himself
against a charge of murder, some years before, shows that he in
imagination completely flung from himself the <em>nominal</em> crime imputed
to him: he might, indeed, have staggered an old man with a blow,
and buried his body in a cave, and lived ever since upon the money
he found upon him, but there was ‘no malice in the case, none at
all,’ as Peachum says. The very coolness, subtlety, and circumspection
of his defence (as masterly a legal document as there is
upon record) prove that he was guilty of the act, as much as they
prove that he was unconscious of the <em>crime</em>.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a> In the same spirit, and
I conceive with great metaphysical truth, Mr. Coleridge, in his
tragedy of <cite>Remorse</cite>, makes Ordonio (his chief character) wave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>acknowledgment of his meditated guilt to his own mind, by putting
into his mouth that striking soliloquy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Say, I had lay’d a body in the sun!</div>
      <div class='line'>Well! in a month there swarm forth from the corse</div>
      <div class='line'>A thousand, nay, ten thousand sentient beings</div>
      <div class='line'>In place of that one man. Say I had <em>kill’d</em> him!</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet who shall tell me, that each one and all</div>
      <div class='line'>Of these ten thousand lives is not as happy</div>
      <div class='line'>As that one life, which being push’d aside,</div>
      <div class='line'>Made room for these unnumber’d.—<span class='sc'>Act</span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> <span class='fss'>SC.</span> <span class='fss'>II.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I am not sure, indeed, that I have not got this whole train of
speculation from him; but I should not think the worse of it on that
account. That gentleman, I recollect, once asked me whether I
thought that the different members of a family really liked one
another so well, or had so much attachment as was generally
supposed: and I said that I conceived the regard they had
towards each other was expressed by the word <em>interest</em>, rather than by
any other; which he said was the true answer. I do not know
that I could mend it now. Natural affection is not pleasure in one
another’s company, nor admiration of one another’s qualities; but it
is an intimate and deep knowledge of the things that affect those, to
whom we are bound by the nearest ties, with pleasure or pain; it is
an anxious, uneasy, fellow-feeling with them, a jealous watchfulness
over their good name, a tender and unconquerable yearning for their
good. The love, in short, we bear them, is the nearest to that we
bear ourselves. <em>Home</em>, according to the old saying, <em>is home, be it
never so homely</em>. We love ourselves, not according to our deserts,
but our cravings after good: so we love our immediate relations in
the next degree (if not, even sometimes a higher one) because we
know best what they have suffered and what sits nearest to their
hearts. We are implicated, in fact, in their welfare, by habit and
sympathy, as we are in our own.</p>

<p class='c013'>If our devotion to our own interests is much the same as to theirs,
we are ignorant of our own characters for the same reason. We are
parties too much concerned to return a fair verdict, and are too much
in the secret of our own motives or situation not to be able to give a
favourable turn to our actions. We exercise a liberal criticism upon
ourselves, and put off the final decision to a late day. The field is
large and open. Hamlet exclaims, with a noble magnanimity, ‘I
count myself indifferent honest, and yet I could accuse me of such
things!’ If you could prove to a man that he is a knave, it would
not make much difference in his opinion, his self-love is stronger than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>his love of virtue. Hypocrisy is generally used as a mask to deceive
the world, not to impose on ourselves: for once detect the delinquent
in his knavery, and he laughs in your face or glories in his iniquity.
This at least happens except where there is a contradiction in the
character, and our vices are involuntary, and at variance with our
convictions. One great difficulty is to distinguish ostensible motives,
or such as we acknowledge to ourselves, from tacit or secret springs
of action. A man changes his opinion readily, he thinks it candour:
it is levity of mind. For the most part, we are stunned and stupid
in judging of ourselves. We are callous by custom to our defects or
excellencies, unless where vanity steps in to exaggerate or extenuate
them. I cannot conceive how it is that people are in love with their
own persons, or astonished at their own performances, which are but
a nine days’ wonder to every one else. In general it may be laid
down that we are liable to this two-fold mistake in judging of our
own talents: we, in the first place, nurse the rickety bantling, we
think much of that which has cost us much pains and labour, and
comes against the grain; and we also set little store by what we do
with most ease to ourselves, and therefore best. The works of the
greatest genius are produced almost unconsciously, with an ignorance
on the part of the persons themselves that they have done any thing
extraordinary. Nature has done it for them. How little Shakespear
seems to have thought of himself or of his fame! Yet, if ‘to
know another well, were to know one’s self,’ he must have been
acquainted with his own pretensions and character, ‘who knew all
qualities with a learned spirit.’ His eye seems never to have been
bent upon himself, but outwards upon nature. A man, who thinks
highly of himself, may almost set it down that it is without reason.
Milton, notwithstanding, appears to have had a high opinion of
himself, and to have made it good. He was conscious of his powers,
and great by design. Perhaps his tenaciousness, on the score of his
own merit, might arise from an early habit of polemical writing,
in which his pretensions were continually called to the bar of
prejudice and party-spirit, and he had to plead not guilty to the
indictment. Some men have died unconscious of immortality,
as others have almost exhausted the sense of it in their life-times.
Correggio might be mentioned as an instance of the one, Voltaire of
the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is nothing that helps a man in his conduct through life
more than a knowledge of his own characteristic weaknesses (which,
guarded against, become his strength), as there is nothing that tends
more to the success of a man’s talents than his knowing the limits of
his faculties, which are thus concentrated on some practicable object.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>One man can do but one thing. Universal pretensions end in
nothing. Or, as Butler has it, too much wit requires</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>

      <div class='line'>‘As much again to govern it.’</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>There are those who have gone, for want of this self-knowledge,
strangely out of their way, and others who have never found it. We
find many who succeed in certain departments, and are yet melancholy
and dissatisfied, because they failed in the one to which they
first devoted themselves, like discarded lovers, who pine after their
scornful mistress. I will conclude with observing, that authors in
general overrate the extent and value of posthumous fame: for what
(as it has been asked) is the amount even of Shakespear’s fame?
That in that very country which boasts his genius and his birth,
perhaps, scarce one person in ten has ever heard of his name, or read
a syllable of his writings!</p>

<p class='c009'>The natural in visible objects is whatever is ordinarily presented to
the senses: the picturesque is that which stands out, and catches the
attention by some striking peculiarity: the <em>ideal</em> is that which answers
to the preconceived imagination and appetite in the mind for love and
beauty. The picturesque depends chiefly on the principle of discrimination
or contrast; the <em>ideal</em> on harmony and continuity of
effect: the one surprises, the other satisfies the mind; the one starts
off from a given point, the other reposes on itself; the one is
determined by an excess of form, the other by a concentration of
feeling.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picturesque may be considered as something like an excrescence
on the face of nature. It runs imperceptibly into the
fantastical and grotesque. Fairies and satyrs are picturesque; but
they are scarcely <em>ideal</em>. They are an extreme and unique conception
of a certain thing, but not of what the mind delights in, or
broods fondly over. The image created by the artist’s hand is not
moulded and fashioned by the love of good and yearning after grace
and beauty, but rather the contrary: that is, they are idea deformity,
not ideal beauty. Rubens was perhaps the most picturesque of
painters; but he was almost the least <em>ideal</em>. So Rembrandt was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>(out of sight) the most picturesque of colourists; as Correggio was
the most <em>ideal</em>. In other words, his composition of light and shade
is more a whole, more in unison, more blended into the same
harmonious feeling than Rembrandt’s, who staggers by contrast,
but does not soothe by gradation. Correggio’s forms, indeed, had a
picturesque air; for they often incline (even when most beautiful) to
the quaintness of caricature. Vandyke, I think, was at once the
least picturesque and least <em>ideal</em> of all the great painters. He was
purely natural, and neither selected from outward forms nor added
any thing from his own mind. He owes every thing to perfect
truth, clearness, and transparency; and though his productions
certainly arrest the eye, and strike in a room full of pictures, it
is from the contrast they present to other pictures, and from being
stripped quite naked of all artificial advantages. They strike almost
as a piece of white paper would, hung up in the same situation.—I
began with saying that whatever stands out from a given line, and as it
were projects upon the eye, is picturesque; and this holds true (comparatively)
in form and colour. A rough terrier-dog, with the hair
bristled and matted together, is picturesque. As we say, there is
a decided character in it, a marked determination to an extreme
point. A shock-dog is odd and disagreeable, but there is nothing
picturesque in its appearance: it is a mere mass of flimsy confusion.
A goat with projecting horns and pendent beard is a picturesque
animal: a sheep is not. A horse is only picturesque from opposition
of colour; as in Mr. Northcote’s study of Gadshill, where the white
horse’s head coming against the dark scowling face of the man makes
as fine a contrast as can be imagined. An old stump of a tree with
rugged bark, and one or two straggling branches, a little stunted
hedge-row line, marking the boundary of the horizon, a stubble-field,
a winding path, a rock seen against the sky, are picturesque, because
they have all of them prominence and a distinctive character of their
own. They are not objects (to borrow Shakespear’s phrase) ‘of no
mark or likelihood.’ A country may be beautiful, romantic, or
sublime, without being picturesque. The Lakes in the North of
England are not picturesque, though certainly the most interesting
sight in this country. To be a subject for painting, a prospect must
present sharp striking points of view or singular forms, or one object
must relieve and set off another. There must be distinct stages and
salient points for the eye to rest upon or start from, in its progress
over the expanse before it. The distance of a landscape will oftentimes
look flat or heavy, that the trunk of a tree or a ruin in the
foreground would immediately throw into perspective and turn to air.
Rembrandt’s landscapes are the least picturesque in the world, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>from the strait lines and sharp angles, the deep incision and dragging
of his pencil, like a harrow over the ground, and the broad contrast
of earth and sky. Earth, in his copies, is rough and hairy; and
Pan has struck his hoof against it!—A camel is a picturesque
ornament in a landscape or history-piece. This is not merely from
its romantic and oriental character; for an elephant has not the same
effect, and if introduced as a necessary appendage, is also an unwieldy
incumbrance. A negro’s head in a group is picturesque from contrast:
so are the spots on a panther’s hide. This was the principle
that Paul Veronese went upon, who said the rule for composition was
<em>black upon white, and white upon black</em>. He was a pretty good
judge. His celebrated picture of the Marriage of Cana is in all
likelihood the completest piece of workmanship extant in the art.
When I saw it, it nearly covered one side of a large room in the
Louvre (being itself forty feet by twenty)—and it seemed as if that
side of the apartment was thrown open, and you looked out at the
open sky, at buildings, marble pillars, galleries with people in them,
emperors, female slaves, Turks, negroes, musicians, all the famous
painters of the time, the tables loaded with viands, goblets, and dogs
under them—a sparkling, overwhelming confusion, a bright, unexpected
reality—the only fault you could find was that no miracle
was going on in the faces of the spectators: the only miracle there
was the picture itself! A French gentleman, who showed me this
‘triumph of painting’ (as it has been called), perceiving I was struck
with it, observed, ‘My wife admires it exceedingly for the facility of
the execution.’ I took this proof of sympathy for a compliment.
It is said that when Humboldt, the celebrated traveller and naturalist,
was introduced to Buonaparte, the Emperor addressed him in these
words—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous aimez, la botanique, Monsieur</span></i>’—and on the other’s
replying in the affirmative, added—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et ma femme aussi!</span></i>’ This has
been found fault with as a piece of brutality and insolence in the
great man by bigoted critics, who do not know what a thing it is to
get a Frenchwoman to agree with them in any point. For my part,
I took the observation as it was meant, and it did not put me out of
conceit with myself or the picture that Madame M— liked it as
well as <em>Monsieur l’Anglois</em>. Certainly, there could be no harm in
that. By the side of it happened to be hung two allegorical pictures
of Rubens (and in such matters he too was ‘no baby<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a>’)—I don’t
remember what the figures were, but the texture seemed of wool or
cotton. The texture of the Paul Veronese was not wool or cotton,
but stuff, jewels, flesh, marble, air, whatever composed the essence of
the varied subjects, in endless relief and truth of handling. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Fleming had seen his two allegories hanging where they did, he
would, without a question, have wished them far enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>I imagine that Rubens’s landscapes are picturesque: Claude’s are
<em>ideal</em>. Rubens is always in extremes: Claude in the middle. Rubens
carries some one peculiar quality or feature of nature to the utmost
verge of probability: Claude balances and harmonises different forms
and masses with laboured delicacy, so that nothing falls short, no one
thing overpowers another. Rainbows, showers, partial gleams of
sunshine, moonlight, are the means with which Rubens produces his
most gorgeous and enchanting effects: there are neither rainbows,
nor showers, nor sudden bursts of sunshine, nor glittering moon-beams
in Claude. He is all softness and proportion; the other is all spirit
and brilliant excess. The two sides (for example) of one of Claude’s
landscapes balance one another, as in a scale of beauty: in Rubens
the several objects are grouped and thrown together with capricious
wantonness. Claude has more repose: Rubens more gaiety and extravagance.
And here it might be asked, Is a rainbow a picturesque
or an <em>ideal</em> object? It seems to me to be both. It is an accident in
nature; but it is an inmate of the fancy. It startles and surprises
the sense, but it soothes and tranquillises the spirit. It makes the
eye glisten to behold it, but the mind turns to it long after it has
faded from its place in the sky. It has both properties then of
giving an extraordinary impulse to the mind by the singularity of its
appearance, and of riveting the imagination by its intense beauty.
I may just notice here in passing, that I think the effect of moonlight
is treated in an <em>ideal</em> manner in the well-known line in
Shakespear—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘See how the moonlight <em>sleeps</em> upon yon bank!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The image is heightened by the exquisiteness of the expression
beyond its natural beauty, and it seems as if there could be no end
to the delight taken in it.—A number of sheep coming to a pool of
water to drink, with shady trees in the back-ground, the rest of the
flock following them, and the shepherd and his dog left carelessly
behind, is surely the <em>ideal</em> in landscape-composition, if the <em>ideal</em> has
its source in the interest excited by a subject, in its power of drawing
the affections after it linked in a golden chain, and in the desire of
the mind to dwell on it for ever. The <em>ideal</em>, in a word, is the
height of the pleasing, that which satisfies and accords with the
inmost longing of the soul: the picturesque is merely a sharper and
bolder impression of reality. A morning mist drawing a slender
veil over all objects is at once picturesque and <em>ideal</em>: for it in the
first place excites immediate surprise and admiration, and in the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>a wish for it to continue, and a fear lest it should be too soon
dissipated. Is the Cupid riding on a lion in the ceiling at Whitehall,
and urging him with a spear over a precipice, with only clouds and
sky beyond, most picturesque or <em>ideal</em>? It has every effect of
startling contrast and situation, and yet inspires breathless expectation
and wonder for the event. Rembrandt’s Jacob’s Dream, again,
is both—fearful to the eye, but realising that loftiest vision of the
soul. Take two faces in Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper, the
Judas and the St. John; the one is all strength, repulsive character,
the other is all divine grace and mild sensibility. The individual,
the characteristic in painting, is that <em>which is</em> in a marked manner—the
<em>ideal</em> is that which we wish any thing to be, and to contemplate
without measure and without end. The first is truth, the last is good.
The one appeals to the sense and understanding, the other to the will
and the affections. The truly beautiful and grand attracts the mind
to it by instinctive harmony, is absorbed in it, and nothing can ever
part them afterwards. Look at a Madonna of Raphael’s: what
gives the <em>ideal</em> character to the expression,—the insatiable purpose
of the soul, or its measureless content in the object of its contemplation?
A portrait of Vandyke’s is mere indifference and still-life in
the comparison: it has not in it the principle of growing and still
unsatisfied desire. In the <em>ideal</em> there is no fixed stint or limit but
the limit of possibility: it is the infinite with respect to human
capacities and wishes. Love is for this reason an <em>ideal</em> passion.
We give to it our all of hope, of fear, of present enjoyment, and
stake our last chance of happiness wilfully and desperately upon it.

<p class='c015'>How many fair catechumens will there be found in all ages to repeat
as much after Shakespear’s Juliet!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ESSAY XXXIII<br /> <span class='small'>ON THE FEAR OF DEATH</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>‘And our little life is rounded with a sleep.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps the best cure for the fear of death is to reflect that life has
a beginning as well as an end. There was a time when we were
not: this gives us no concern—why then should it trouble us that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>a time will come when we shall cease to be? I have no wish to
have been alive a hundred years ago, or in the reign of Queen Anne:
why should I regret and lay it so much to heart that I shall not
be alive a hundred years hence, in the reign of I cannot tell whom?</p>

<p class='c013'>When Bickerstaff wrote his Essays, I knew nothing of the
subjects of them: nay, much later, and but the other day, as it
were, in the beginning of the reign of George III. when Goldsmith,
Johnson, Burke, used to meet at the Globe, when Garrick was in
his glory, and Reynolds was over head and ears with his portraits,
and Sterne brought out the volumes of Tristram Shandy year by
year, it was without consulting me: I had not the slightest intimation
of what was going on: the debates in the House of Commons
on the American war, or the firing at Bunker’s hill, disturbed not
me: yet I thought this no evil—I neither ate, drank, nor was
merry, yet I did not complain: I had not then looked out into
this breathing world, yet I was well; and the world did quite as
well without me as I did without it! Why then should I make
all this outcry about parting with it, and being no worse off than
I was before? There is nothing in the recollection that at a certain
time we were not come into the world, that ‘the gorge rises at’—why
should we revolt at the idea that we must one day go out of it?
To die is only to be as we were before we were born; yet no one
feels any remorse, or regret, or repugnance, in contemplating this
last idea. It is rather a relief and disburthening of the mind: it
seems to have been holiday-time with us then: we were not called
to appear upon the stage of life, to wear robes or tatters, to laugh
or cry, be hooted or applauded; we had lain <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdus</span></i> all this while,
snug, out of harm’s way; and had slept out our thousands of centuries
without wanting to be waked up; at peace and free from care,
in a long nonage, in a sleep deeper and calmer than that of infancy,
wrapped in the softest and finest dust. And the worst that we dread
is, after a short, fretful, feverish being, after vain hopes, and idle
fears, to sink to final repose again, and forget the troubled dream of
life!... Ye armed men, knights templars, that sleep in the stone
aisles of that old Temple church, where all is silent above, and
where a deeper silence reigns below (not broken by the pealing
organ), are ye not contented where ye lie? Or would you come out
of your long homes to go to the Holy War? Or do ye complain
that pain no longer visits you, that sickness has done its worst, that
you have paid the last debt to nature, that you hear no more of the
thickening phalanx of the foe, or your lady’s waning love; and that
while this ball of earth rolls its eternal round, no sound shall ever
pierce through to disturb your lasting repose, fixed as the marble over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>your tombs, breathless as the grave that holds you! And thou, oh!
thou, to whom my heart turns, and will turn while it has feeling left,
who didst love in vain, and whose first was thy last sigh, wilt not
thou too rest in peace (or wilt thou cry to me complaining from thy
clay-cold bed) when that sad heart is no longer sad, and that sorrow
is dead which thou wert only called into the world to feel!</p>

<p class='c013'>It is certain that there is nothing in the idea of a pre-existent state
that excites our longing like the prospect of a posthumous existence.
We are satisfied to have begun life when we did; we have no ambition
to have set out on our journey sooner; and feel that we have
had quite enough to do to battle our way through since. We
cannot say,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The wars we well remember of King Nine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of old Assaracus and Inachus divine.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Neither have we any wish: we are contented to read of them in
story, and to stand and gaze at the vast sea of time that separates us
from them. It was early days then: the world was not <em>well-aired</em>
enough for us: we have no inclination to have been up and stirring.
We do not consider the six thousand years of the world before we
were born as so much time lost to us: we are perfectly indifferent
about the matter. We do not grieve and lament that we did not
happen to be in time to see the grand mask and pageant of human life
going on in all that period; though we are mortified at being obliged
to quit our stand before the rest of the procession passes.</p>

<p class='c013'>It may be suggested in explanation of this difference, that we
know from various records and traditions what happened in the time
of Queen Anne, or even in the reigns of the Assyrian monarchs:
but that we have no means of ascertaining what is to happen hereafter
but by awaiting the event, and that our eagerness and curiosity are
sharpened in proportion as we are in the dark about it. This is not
at all the case; for at that rate we should be constantly wishing to
make a voyage of discovery to Greenland or to the Moon, neither of
which we have, in general, the least desire to do. Neither, in truth,
have we any particular solicitude to pry into the secrets of futurity,
but as a pretext for prolonging our own existence. It is not so much
that we care to be alive a hundred or a thousand years hence, any
more than to have been alive a hundred or a thousand years ago: but
the thing lies here, that we would all of us wish the present moment
to last for ever. We would be as we are, and would have the world
remain just as it is, to please us.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>to have and to hold while it may; and abhors, on any terms, to have
it torn from us, and nothing left in its room. It is the pang of
parting, the unloosing our grasp, the breaking asunder some strong tie,
the leaving some cherished purpose unfulfilled, that creates the repugnance
to go, and ‘makes calamity of so long life,’ as it often is.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>—‘Oh! thou strong heart!</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s such a covenant ’twixt the world and thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>They’re loth to break!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The love of life, then, is an habitual attachment, not an abstract
principle. Simply <em>to be</em> does not ‘content man’s natural desire:’ we
long to be in a certain time, place, and circumstance. We would
much rather be now, ‘on this bank and shoal of time,’ than have our
choice of any future period, than take a slice of fifty or sixty years
out of the Millennium, for instance. This shows that our attachment
is not confined either to <em>being</em> or to <em>well-being</em>; but that we have an
inveterate prejudice in favour of our immediate existence, such as it
is. The mountaineer will not leave his rock, nor the savage his hut;
neither are we willing to give up our present mode of life, with all its
advantages and disadvantages, for any other that could be substituted
for it. No man would, I think, exchange his existence with any
other man, however fortunate. We had as lief <em>not be</em>, as <em>not be ourselves</em>.
There are some persons of that reach of soul that they would
like to live two hundred and fifty years hence, to see to what height
of empire America will have grown up in that period, or whether the
English constitution will last so long. These are points beyond me.
But I confess I should like to live to see the downfall of the Bourbons.
That is a vital question with me; and I shall like it the better, the
sooner it happens!</p>

<p class='c013'>No young man ever thinks he shall die. He may believe that
others will, or assent to the doctrine that ‘all men are mortal’ as an
abstract proposition, but he is far enough from bringing it home to
himself individually.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a> Youth, buoyant activity, and animal spirits,
hold absolute antipathy with old age as well as with death; nor have
we, in the hey-day of life, any more than in the thoughtlessness of
childhood, the remotest conception how</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>nor how sanguine, florid health and vigour, shall ‘turn to withered,
weak, and grey.’ Or if in a moment of idle speculation we indulge
in this notion of the close of life as a theory, it is amazing at what a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>distance it seems; what a long, leisurely interval there is between;
what a contrast its slow and solemn approach affords to our present
gay dreams of existence! We eye the farthest verge of the horizon,
and think what a way we shall have to look back upon, ere we arrive
at our journey’s end; and without our in the least suspecting it, the
mists are at our feet, and the shadows of age encompass us. The
two divisions of our lives have melted into each other: the extreme
points close and meet with none of that romantic interval stretching
out between them, that we had reckoned upon; and for the rich,
melancholy, solemn hues of age, ‘the sear, the yellow leaf,’ the
deepening shadows of an autumnal evening, we only feel a dank, cold
mist, encircling all objects, after the spirit of youth is fled. There
is no inducement to look forward; and what is worse, little interest
in looking back to what has become so trite and common. The
pleasures of our existence have worn themselves out, are ‘gone into
the wastes of time,’ or have turned their indifferent side to us: the
pains by their repeated blows have worn us out, and have left us
neither spirit nor inclination to encounter them again in retrospect.
We do not want to rip up old grievances, nor to renew our youth like
the phœnix, nor to live our lives twice over. Once is enough. As
the tree falls, so let it lie. Shut up the book and close the account
once for all!</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been thought by some that life is like the exploring of a
passage that grows narrower and darker the farther we advance,
without a possibility of ever turning back, and where we are stifled
for want of breath at last. For myself, I do not complain of the
greater thickness of the atmosphere as I approach the narrow house.
I felt it more, formerly,<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a> when the idea alone seemed to suppress a
thousand rising hopes, and weighed upon the pulses of the blood. At
present I rather feel a thinness and want of support, I stretch out my
hand to some object and find none, I am too much in a world of
abstraction; the naked map of life is spread out before me, and in the
emptiness and desolation I see Death coming to meet me. In my
youth I could not behold him for the crowd of objects and feelings,
and Hope stood always between us, saying—‘Never mind that old
fellow!’ If I had lived indeed, I should not care to die. But I do
not like a contract of pleasure broken off unfulfilled, a marriage with
joy unconsummated, a promise of happiness rescinded. My public
and private hopes have been left a ruin, or remain only to mock me.
I would wish them to be re-edified. I should like to see some prospect
of good to mankind, such as my life began with. I should like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>to leave some sterling work behind me. I should like to have some
friendly hand to consign me to the grave. On these conditions I am
ready, if not willing, to depart. I shall then write on my tomb—<span class='sc'>Grateful
and Contented</span>! But I have thought and suffered too
much to be willing to have thought and suffered in vain.—In looking
back, it sometimes appears to me as if I had in a manner slept out my
life in a dream or shadow on the side of the hill of knowledge, where
I have fed on books, on thoughts, on pictures, and only heard in
half-murmurs the trampling of busy feet, or the noises of the throng
below. Waked out of this dim, twilight existence, and startled with
the passing scene, I have felt a wish to descend to the world of
realities, and join in the chase. But I fear too late, and that I had
better return to my bookish chimeras and indolence once more!
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Zanetto, lascia le donne, et studia la matematica.</span></i> I will think of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not wonderful that the contemplation and fear of death become
more familiar to us as we approach nearer to it: that life seems to
ebb with the decay of blood and youthful spirits; and that as we
find every thing about us subject to chance and change, as our
strength and beauty die, as our hopes and passions, our friends and
our affections leave us, we begin by degrees to feel ourselves mortal!</p>

<p class='c013'>I have never seen death but once, and that was in an infant. It is
years ago. The look was calm and placid, and the face was fair
and firm. It was as if a waxen image had been laid out in the
coffin, and strewed with innocent flowers. It was not like death,
but more like an image of life! No breath moved the lips, no pulse
stirred, no sight or sound would enter those eyes or ears more.
While I looked at it, I saw no pain was there; it seemed to smile at
the short pang of life which was over: but I could not bear the
coffin-lid to be closed—it seemed to stifle me; and still as the nettles
wave in a corner of the churchyard over his little grave, the welcome
breeze helps to refresh me, and ease the tightness at my breast!</p>

<p class='c013'>An ivory or marble image, like Chantry’s monument of the two
children, is contemplated with pure delight. Why do we not grieve
and fret that the marble is not alive, or fancy that it has a shortness
of breath? It never was alive; and it is the difficulty of making the
transition from life to death, the struggle between the two in our
imagination, that confounds their properties painfully together, and
makes us conceive that the infant that is but just dead, still wants to
breathe, to enjoy, and look about it, and is prevented by the icy hand
of death, locking up its faculties and benumbing its senses; so that,
if it could, it would complain of its own hard state. Perhaps
religious considerations reconcile the mind to this change sooner than
any others, by representing the spirit as fled to another sphere, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>leaving the body behind it. So in reflecting on death generally, we
mix up the idea of life with it, and thus make it the ghastly monster
it is. We think how we should feel, not how the dead feel.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘The melancholy appearance of a lifeless body, the mansion
provided for it to inhabit, dark, cold, close and solitary, are shocking
to the imagination; but it is to the imagination only, not the understanding;
for whoever consults this faculty will see at first glance,
that there is nothing dismal in all these circumstances: if the corpse
were kept wrapped up in a warm bed, with a roasting fire in the
chamber, it would feel no comfortable warmth therefrom; were
store of tapers lighted up as soon as day shuts in, it would see no
objects to divert it; were it left at large it would have no liberty,
nor if surrounded with company would be cheered thereby; neither
are the distorted features expressions of pain, uneasiness, or distress.
This every one knows, and will readily allow upon being suggested,
yet still cannot behold, nor even cast a thought upon those objects
without shuddering; for knowing that a living person must suffer
grievously under such appearances, they become habitually formidable
to the mind, and strike a mechanical horror, which is increased by
the customs of the world around us.’</p>

<p class='c013'>There is usually one pang added voluntarily and unnecessarily to
the fear of death, by our affecting to compassionate the loss which
others will have in us. If that were all, we might reasonably set our
minds at rest. The pathetic exhortation on country tombstones,
‘Grieve not for me, my wife and children dear,’ &amp;c. is for the most
part speedily followed to the letter. We do not leave so great a
void in society as we are inclined to imagine, partly to magnify our
own importance, and partly to console ourselves by sympathy. Even
in the same family the gap is not so great; the wound closes up
sooner than we should expect. Nay, <em>our room</em> is not unfrequently
thought better than <em>our company</em>. People walk along the streets the
day after our deaths just as they did before, and the crowd is not
diminished. While we were living, the world seemed in a manner to
exist only for us, for our delight and amusement, because it contributed
to them. But our hearts cease to beat, and it goes on as usual, and
thinks no more about us than it did in our life-time. The million are
devoid of sentiment, and care as little for you or me as if we belonged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>to the moon. We live the week over in the Sunday’s paper, or
are decently interred in some obituary at the month’s end! It is
not surprising that we are forgotten so soon after we quit this
mortal stage: we are scarcely noticed, while we are on it. It is not
merely that our names are not known in China—they have hardly been
heard of in the next street. We are hand and glove with the
universe, and think the obligation is mutual. This is an evident
fallacy. If this, however, does not trouble us now, it will not
hereafter. A handful of dust can have no quarrel to pick with its
neighbours, or complaint to make against Providence, and might well
exclaim, if it had but an understanding and a tongue, ‘Go thy ways,
old world, swing round in blue ether, voluble to every age, you and
I shall no more jostle!’</p>

<p class='c013'>It is amazing how soon the rich and titled, and even some of those
who have wielded great political power, are forgotten.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A little rule, a little sway,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is all the great and mighty have</div>
      <div class='line'>Betwixt the cradle and the grave’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and, after its short date, they hardly leave a name behind them. ‘A
great man’s memory may, at the common rate, survive him half a
year.’ His heirs and successors take his titles, his power, and his
wealth—all that made him considerable or courted by others; and
he has left nothing else behind him either to delight or benefit
the world. Posterity are not by any means so disinterested as they
are supposed to be. They give their gratitude and admiration only
in return for benefits conferred. They cherish the memory of those
to whom they are indebted for instruction and delight; and they
cherish it just in proportion to the instruction and delight they
are conscious they receive. The sentiment of admiration springs
immediately from this ground; and cannot be otherwise than well
founded.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The effeminate clinging to life as such, as a general or abstract
idea, is the effect of a highly civilised and artificial state of society.
Men formerly plunged into all the vicissitudes and dangers of war, or
staked their all upon a single die, or some one passion, which if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>could not have gratified, life became a burthen to them—now our
strongest passion is to think, our chief amusement is to read new
plays, new poems, new novels, and this we may do at our leisure, in
perfect security, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>. If we look into the old histories and
romances, before the <em>belles-lettres</em> neutralised human affairs and reduced
passion to a state of mental equivocation, we find the heroes and
heroines not setting their lives ‘at a pin’s fee,’ but rather courting
opportunities of throwing them away in very wantonness of spirit.
They raise their fondness for some favourite pursuit to its height, to
a pitch of madness, and think no price too dear to pay for its full
gratification. Every thing else is dross. They go to death as to
a bridal bed, and sacrifice themselves or others without remorse at the
shrine of love, of honour, of religion, or any other prevailing feeling.
Romeo runs his ‘sea-sick, weary bark upon the rocks’ of death, the
instant he finds himself deprived of his Juliet; and she clasps his
neck in their last agonies, and follows him to the same fatal shore.
One strong idea takes possession of the mind and overrules every
other; and even life itself, joyless without that, becomes an object of
indifference or loathing. There is at least more of imagination in
such a state of things, more vigour of feeling and promptitude to act
than in our lingering, languid, protracted attachment to life for its
own poor sake. It is, perhaps, also better, as well as more heroical,
to strike at some daring or darling object, and if we fail in that, to
take the consequences manfully, than to renew the lease of a tedious,
spiritless, charmless existence, merely (as Pierre says) ‘to lose it
afterwards in some vile brawl’ for some worthless object. Was there
not a spirit of martyrdom as well as a spice of the reckless energy of
barbarism in this bold defiance of death? Had not religion something
to do with it; the implicit belief in a future life, which rendered this
of less value, and embodied something beyond it to the imagination;
so that the rough soldier, the infatuated lover, the valorous knight,
&amp;c. could afford to throw away the present venture, and take a leap
into the arms of futurity, which the modern sceptic shrinks back
from, with all his boasted reason and vain philosophy, weaker than a
woman! I cannot help thinking so myself; but I have endeavoured
to explain this point before, and will not enlarge farther on it here.</p>

<p class='c013'>A life of action and danger moderates the dread of death. It not
only gives us fortitude to bear pain, but teaches us at every step the
precarious tenure on which we hold our present being. Sedentary
and studious men are the most apprehensive on this score. Dr.
Johnson was an instance in point. A few years seemed to him soon
over, compared with those sweeping contemplations on time and
infinity with which he had been used to pose himself. In the <em>still-life</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>of a man of letters, there was no obvious reason for a change. He
might sit in an arm-chair and pour out cups of tea to all eternity.
Would it had been possible for him to do so! The most rational
cure after all for the inordinate fear of death is to set a just value on
life. If we merely wish to continue on the scene to indulge our
headstrong humours and tormenting passions, we had better begone at
once: and if we only cherish a fondness for existence according to
the good we derive from it, the pang we feel at parting with it will
not be very severe!</p>

  <h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE FIRST</h4>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Called on Mr. Northcote; had, as usual, an interesting conversation.
Spoke of some account of Lord Byron in a newspaper, which
he thought must be like. ‘The writer says, he did not wish to be
thought merely a great poet. My sister asked, “What then did he
wish to be thought?” Why, I’ll tell you; he wished to be something
different from every body else. As to nobility, there were
many others before him, so that he could not rely upon that; and
then, as to poetry, there are so many wretched creatures that pretend
to the name, that he looked at it with disgust: he thought himself
as distinct from them as the stars in the firmament. It comes to
what Sir Joshua used to say, that a man who is at the head of his
profession is above it. I remember being at Cosway’s, where they
were recommending some charitable institution for the relief of
decayed artists; and I said I would not be of it, for it was holding
out a temptation to idleness, and bringing those into the profession
who were not fit for it. Some one who wanted to flatter me
observed, “I wonder you should talk in this manner, who are under
such obligations to the art!” I answered immediately, “If I am
to take your compliment as I believe it is meant, I might answer,
that it is the art that is under obligations to me, not I to it. Do
you suppose that Rubens, Titian, and others were under obligations
to the art—they who raised it from obscurity and made it all that
it is? What would the art be without these?” The world in
general, as Miss Reynolds used to say, with reference to her brother,
think no more of a painter than they do of a fiddler or a dancing-master
or a piano-forte-maker. And so of a poet. I have always
said of that dispute about burying Lord Byron in Poet’s Corner,
that he would have resisted it violently if he could have known of it.
Not but there were many very eminent names there, with whom he
would like to be associated; but then there were others that he
would look down upon. If they had laid him there, he would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>got up again. No; I’ll tell you where they should have laid him—if
they had buried him with the kings in Henry <span class='fss'>VII.</span> Chapel, he
would have had no objection to that! One cannot alter the names
of things, or the prejudices of the world respecting them, to suit one’s
convenience. I once went with Hoppner to the hustings to vote for
Horne Tooke; and when they asked me what I was, I said, a painter.
At this Hoppner was very mad all the way home, and said I should
have called myself a portrait-painter. I replied, the world had no
time to trouble their heads about such distinctions. I afterwards
asked Kemble, who agreed I was right, that he always called himself
a player,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c013'>I then observed, I had been to the play with G. and his daughter,
from the last of whom I had learnt something about Lord Byron’s
conversation. ‘What!’ he said, ‘the beauty-daughter?’ I said,
‘Do you think her a beauty, then?’—‘Why no, she rather thinks
herself one, and yet there is something about her that would pass for
such. Girls generally find out where to place themselves. She’s
clever too; isn’t she?’—‘Oh! yes.’—‘What did she tell you about
Lord Byron? because I am curious to know all about him.’—‘I
asked her if it was true that Lord Byron was so poor a creature as
H— represented him? She at first misunderstood me, and said,
nothing could be meaner than he was, and gave some instances of it.
I said, that was not what I meant; that I could believe any thing of
that kind of him; that whatever he took in his head he would carry
to extremes, regardless of every thing but the feeling of the moment;
but that I could not conceive him to be in conversation, or in any
other way, a flat and <em>common-place</em> person.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a> “Oh! no,” she said,
“he was not. H— was hardly a fair judge. The other had not
behaved well to him, and whenever they met, H— always began
some kind of argument, and as Lord Byron could not argue, they
made but a bad piece of business of it, and it ended unsatisfactorily
for all parties.” I said, H— was too apt to put people to their
trumps, or to force them upon doing not what <em>they</em> could do, but what
he thought <em>he</em> could do. He, however, not only gave his own opinion,
but said, Mr. S— could only just endure Lord Byron’s company.
This seemed to me odd; for though he might be neither orator nor
philosopher, yet any thing he might say or only stammer out in
broken sentences, must be interesting: a glance, a gesture would be
full of meaning; or he would make one look about one like the
tree in Virgil, that expressed itself by groans. To this she assented,
and observed—“At least S— and myself found it so; for we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>generally sat with him till morning. He was perhaps a little moody
and reserved at first; but by touching on certain strings, he began to
unbend, and gave the most extraordinary accounts of his own feelings
and adventures that could be imagined. Besides, he was very handsome,
and it was some satisfaction to look at a head at once so
beautiful and expressive!” I repeated what H— told me, that
when he and Lord Byron met in Italy, they did not know one
another; he himself from having grown so thin, and Byron from
having grown so fat, like a great chubby school-boy—a circumstance
which shocked his lordship so much, that he took to drinking vinegar
at a great rate, that he might recover the figure of the stripling God.
I mentioned some things that H— had reported of Lord Byron;
such as his saying, “He never cared for any thing above a day,”—which
might be merely in a fit of spleen, or from the spirit of contradiction,
or to avoid an imputation of <em>sentimentality</em>.’—‘Oh!’ said
Northcote, ‘that will never do, to take things literally that are uttered
in a moment of irritation. You do not express your own opinion,
but one as opposite as possible to that of the person that has provoked
you. You get as far from a person you have taken a pique against
as you can, just as you turn off the pavement to get out of the way
of a chimney-sweeper; but it is not to be supposed you prefer walking
in the mud, for all that! I have often been ashamed myself of
speeches I have made in that way, which have been repeated to me
as <em>good things</em>, when all I meant was that I would say any thing
sooner than agree to the nonsense or affectation I heard. You then
set yourself against what you think a wrong bias in another, and are
not like a wall but a buttress—as far from the right line as your
antagonist; and the more absurd he is, the more so do you become.
Before you attend to what any one says, you should ask, Was he
talking to a fool or a wise man? No; H— would make Lord
Byron tributary to him, or would make him out to be nothing. I
wonder you admire him as you do, and compare him to the wits of
Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> It isn’t writing verses or painting a picture—that, as Sir
Joshua used to say, is what every body can do: but it is the doing
something more than any body else can do that entitles the poet or
the artist to distinction, or makes the work live. But these people
shut themselves up in a little circle of their own, and fancy all the
world are looking at them.’ I said, H— had been spoiled by
flattery when he was young. ‘Oh! no,’ he said, ‘it was not that.
Sir Joshua was not spoiled by flattery, and yet he had as much of
it as any body need have; but he was looking out to see what the
world said of him, or thinking what figure he should make by
the side of Correggio or Vandyke, not pluming himself on being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>a better painter than some one in the next street, or being surprised
that the people at his own table spoke in praise of his pictures. It
is a little mind that is taken up with the nearest object, or puffed
up with immediate notice: to do any thing great, we must look out
of ourselves and see things upon a broader scale.’</p>

<p class='c013'>I told Northcote I had promised H— I would bring him to see
him; and then, said I, you would think as favourably of him as I do,
and every body else that knows him. ‘But you didn’t say any thing
in my praise to induce him to come?’—‘Oh! yes; I exerted all
my eloquence.’—‘That wasn’t the way. You should have said I
was a poor creature, perhaps amusing for half an hour or so, or
curious to see like a little dried mummy in a museum: but he would
not hear of your having two idols! Depend upon it, he’ll not come.
Such characters only want to be surrounded with satellites or echoes:
and that is one reason they never improve. True genius, as well as
wisdom, is ever docile, humble, vigilant, and ready to acknowledge
the merit it seeks to appropriate from every quarter. That was
Fuseli’s mistake. Nothing was good enough for him, that was not
a repetition of himself. So once when I told him of a very fine
Vandyke, he made answer—“And what is it? A little bit of
colour. I wouldn’t go across the way to see it.” On my telling
this to Sir Joshua, he said—“Ay, he’ll repent it, he’ll repent it!”
W— is another of those who would narrow the universe to their
own standard. It is droll to see how hard you labour to prop him
up too, and seem to fancy he’ll live.’—‘I think he stands a better
chance than Lord Byron. He has added one original feature to
our poetry, which the other has not; and this, you know, Sir, by
your own rule, gives him the best title.’—‘Yes; but the little bit
that he has added is not enough. None but great objects can be
seen at a distance. If posterity looked at it with your eyes, they
might think his poetry curious and pretty. But consider how many
Sir Walter Scotts, how many Lord Byrons, how many Dr. Johnsons
there will be in the next hundred years; how many reputations will
rise and sink in that time; and do you imagine, amid these conflicting
and important claims, such trifles as descriptions of daisies and idiot-boys
(however well they may be done) will not be swept away in
the tide of time, like straws and weeds by the torrent? No; the
world can only keep in view the principal and most perfect productions
of human ingenuity; such works as Dryden’s, Pope’s, and a few
others, that from their unity, their completeness, their polish have
the stamp of immortality upon them, and seem indestructible like an
element of nature. There are few of these: I fear your friend
W— is not one.’</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>I said, I thought one circumstance against him was the want of
popularity in his life-time. Few people made much noise after their
deaths who did not do so while they were living. Posterity could
not be supposed to rake into the records of past times for the Illustrious
Obscure; and only ratified or annulled the lists of great names
handed down to them by the voice of common fame. Few people
recovered from the neglect or obloquy of their contemporaries. The
public would hardly be at the pains to try the same cause twice
over, or did not like to reverse its own sentence, at least when
on the unfavourable side. There was Hobbes, for instance: he
had a bad name while living, and it was of no use to think at this
time of day of doing him justice. While the priests and politicians
were tearing him in pieces for his atheism and arbitrary principles,
Mr. Locke stole his philosophy from him; and I would fain see
any one restore it to the right owner. Quote the passages one by
one, show that every principle of the modern metaphysical system
was contained in Hobbes, and that all that succeeding writers have
done was to deduce from Mr. Locke’s imperfect concessions the very
consequences, ‘armed all in proof,’ that already existed in an entire
and unmutilated state in his predecessor; and you shall the next day
hear Mr. Locke spoken of as the father of English philosophy as
currently and confidently as if not the shadow of a doubt had ever
been started on the subject. Mr. Hobbes, by the boldness and
comprehensiveness of his views, had shocked the prejudices and
drawn down upon his head the enmity of his contemporaries: Mr.
Locke, by going more cautiously to work, and only admitting as
much at a time as the public mind would bear, prepared the way for
the rest of Mr. Hobbes’s philosophy, and for a vast reputation for
himself, which nothing can impugn. Stat nominis umbra. The
world are too far off to distinguish names from things; and call
Mr. Locke the first of English philosophers, as they call a star by a
particular name, because others call it so. They also dislike to have
their confidence in a great name destroyed, and fear, that by displacing
one of their favoured idols from its niche in the Temple of
Fame, they may endanger the whole building.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Northcote</span>—‘Why, I thought Hobbes stood as high as any body.
I have always heard him spoken of in that light. It is not his
capacity that people dispute, but they object to his character. The
world will not encourage vice, for their own sakes; and they give
a casting-vote in favour of virtue. Mr. Locke was a modest, conscientious
enquirer after truth, and the world had the sagacity to see
this and to be willing to give him a hearing; the other, I conceive,
was a bully, and a bad man into the bargain, and they did not want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>to be bullied into truth or to sanction licentiousness. This is unavoidable;
for the desire of knowledge is but one principle of the
mind. It was the same with Tom Paine. Nobody can deny that
he was a very fine writer and a very sensible man; but he flew in
the face of a whole generation, and no wonder that they were too
much for him, and that his name is become a bye-word with such
multitudes, for no other reason than that he did not care what offence
he gave them by contradicting all their most inveterate prejudices.
If you insult a room-full of people, you will be kicked out of it. So
neither will the world at large be insulted with impunity. If you
tell a whole country that they are fools and knaves, they will not
return the compliment by crying you up as the pink of wisdom and
honesty. Nor will those who come after be very apt to take up
your quarrel. It was not so much Paine’s being a republican or an
unbeliever, as the manner in which he brought his opinions forward
(which showed self-conceit and want of feeling) that subjected him
to obloquy. People did not like the temper of the man: it falls
under the article of moral virtue. There are some reputations that
are great, merely because they are amiable. There is Dr. Watts:
look at the encomiums passed on him by Dr. Johnson; and yet to
what, according to his statement, does his merit amount? Why
only to this, that he did that best which none can do well, and employed
his talents uniformly for the welfare of mankind. He was a
good man, and the voice of the public has given him credit for being
a great one. The world may be forced to do homage to great
talents, but they only bow willingly to these when they are joined
with benevolence and modesty; nor will they put weapons into the
hands of the bold and unprincipled sophist to be turned against their own
interests and wishes.’ I said, there was a great deal in the manner
of bringing truth forward to influence its reception with the reader;
for not only did we resent unwelcome novelties advanced with an
insolent and dogmatical air; but we were even ready to give up our
favourite notions, when we saw them advocated in a harsh and
intolerant manner by those of our own party, sooner than submit to
the pretensions of blindfold presumption. If any thing could make
me a bigot, it would be the arrogance of the free-thinker; if any
thing could make me a slave, it would be the sordid sneering fopperies
and sweeping clauses of the liberal party. Renegadoes are generally
made so, not by the overtures of their adversaries, but by disgust
at the want of candour and moderation in their friends. Northcote
replied—‘To be sure, there was nothing more painful than to have
one’s own opinions disfigured or thrust down one’s throat by impertinence
and folly; and that once when a pedantic coxcomb was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>crying up Raphael to the skies, he could not help saying—“If there
was nothing in Raphael but what <em>you</em> see in him, we should not now
have been talking of him!”’</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE SECOND</h4>

<p class='c009'>When I called, I found Mr. Northcote painting a portrait of himself.
Another stood on an easel. He asked me, which I thought most
like? I said, the one he was about was the best, but not good
enough. It looks like a physician or a member of parliament, but
it ought to look like something more—a Cardinal or a Spanish
Inquisitor! I do not think you ought to proceed in painting your own
face as you do with some others—that is, by trying to improve upon
it: you have only to make it like; for the more like it is, the better
it will be as a picture. ‘Oh! he tried to make it like.’ I found
I had got upon a wrong scent. Mr. Northcote, as an artist, was not
bound to have a fine head, but he was bound to paint one. I am
always a very bad courtier; and think of what strikes me, and not
of the effect upon others. So I once tried to compliment a very
handsome <em>brunette</em>, by telling her how much I admired dark beauties.
‘Oh!’ said Northcote, ‘you should have told her she was fair.
She did not like <em>black</em>, though you did!’ After all, there is a kind
of selfishness in this plain-speaking. In the present case, it set us
wrong the whole morning, and I had to stay longer than usual to
recover the old track. I was continually in danger of oversetting
a stand with a small looking-glass, which Northcote particularly
cautioned me not to touch; and every now and then he was prying
into the glass by stealth, to see if the portrait was like. He had on
a green velvet-cap, and looked very like Titian.</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote then turning round, said, ‘I wanted to ask you about a
speech you made the other day: you said you thought you could
have made something of portrait, but that you never could have
painted history. What did you mean by that?’—‘Oh! all I meant
was, that sometimes when I see a fine Titian or Rembrandt, I feel
as if I could have done something of the same kind with the proper
pains, but I have never the same feeling with respect to Raphael.
My admiration is there utterly unmixed with emulation or regret.
In fact, I see what is before me, but I have no invention.’</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Northcote</span>—‘You do not know till you try. There is not so
much difference as you imagine. Portrait often runs into history,
and history into portrait, without our knowing it. Expression is
common to both, and that is the chief difficulty. The greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>history-painters have always been able portrait-painters. How should
a man paint a thing in motion, if he cannot paint it still? But the
great point is to catch the prevailing look and character: if you are
master of this, you can make almost what use of it you please. If
a portrait has force, it will do for history; and if history is well
painted, it will do for portrait. This is what gave dignity to Sir
Joshua: his portraits had always that determined air and character
that you know what to think of them as if you had seen them
engaged in the most decided action. So Fuseli said of Titian’s
picture of Paul <span class='fss'>III.</span> and his two nephews, “That is true history!”
Many of the groups in the Vatican, by Raphael, are only collections
of fine portraits. That is why West, Barry, and others pretended
to despise portrait, because they could not do it, and it would only
expose their want of truth and nature. No! if you can give the
<em>look</em>, you need not fear painting history. Yet how difficult that is,
and on what slight causes it depends! It is not enough that it is
seen, unless it is at the same time felt. How odd it seems, that
often while you are looking at a face, and though you perceive no
difference in the features, yet you find they have undergone a total
alteration of expression! What a fine hand then is required to trace
what the eye can scarcely be said to distinguish! So I used to
contend against Sir Joshua that Raphael had triumphed over this
difficulty in the Miracle of Bolsena, where he has given the internal
blush of the unbelieving priest at seeing the wafer turned into blood—the
colour to be sure assists, but the look of stupefaction and shame
is also there in the most marked degree. Sir Joshua said it was my
fancy, but I am as convinced of it as I am of my existence; and the
proof is that otherwise he has done nothing. There is no story
without it; but he has trusted to the expression to tell the story,
instead of leaving the expression to be made out from the story. I
have often observed the same thing in myself, when I have blamed
any one as mildly as I could, not using any violence of language, nor
indeed intending to hurt; and I have afterwards wondered at the
effect; my sister has said, “You should have seen your look,” but
I did not know of it myself.—I said, ‘If you had, it would have
been less felt by others.’ An instance of this made me laugh not
long ago. I was offended at a waiter for very ill behaviour at an
inn at Calais; and while he was out of the room, I was putting on
as angry a look as I could, but I found this sort of previous rehearsal
to no purpose. The instant he returned into the room, I gave him
a look that I felt made it unnecessary to tell him what I thought.’—‘To
be sure, he would see it immediately.’—‘And don’t you think,
Sir,’ I said, ‘that this explains the difficulty of fine acting, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>the difference between good acting and bad—that is, between face-making
or mouthing and genuine passion? To give the last, an actor
must possess the highest truth of imagination, and must undergo an
entire revolution of feeling. Is it wonderful that so many prefer an
artificial to a natural actor, the mask to the man, the pompous pretension
to the simple expression? Not at all; the wonder rather is
that people in general judge so right as they do, when they have such
doubtful grounds to go upon; and they would not, but they trust less
to rules or reasoning than to their feelings.’</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Northcote</span>—‘You must come to that at last. The common sense
of mankind (whether a good or a bad one) is the best criterion you
have to appeal to. You necessarily impose upon yourself in judging
of your own works. Whenever I am trying at an expression, I hang
up the picture in the room and ask people what it means, and if they
guess right, I think I have succeeded. You yourself see the thing as
you wish it, or according to what you have been endeavouring to
make it. When I was doing the figures of Argyll in prison and of
his enemy who comes and finds him asleep, I had a great difficulty
to encounter in conveying the expression of the last—indeed I did it
from myself—I wanted to give a look of mingled remorse and admiration;
and when I found that others saw this look in the sketch I
had made, I left off. By going on, I might lose it again. There is
a point of felicity which, whether you fall short of or have gone
beyond it, can only be determined by the effect on the unprejudiced
observer. You cannot be always with your picture to explain it to
others: it must be left to speak for itself. Those who stand before
their pictures and make fine speeches about them, do themselves a
world of harm: a painter should cut out his tongue, if he wishes to
succeed. His language addresses itself not to the ear, but the eye.
He should stick to that as much as possible. Sometimes you hit
off an effect without knowing it. Indeed the happiest results are
frequently the most unconscious. Boaden was here the other day.
You don’t remember Henderson, I suppose?’—‘No.’—‘He says
his reading was the most perfect he ever knew. He thought himself
a pretty good reader and a tolerable mimic; that he succeeded
tolerably well in imitating Kemble, Mrs. Siddons, and others, but
that there was something in Henderson’s reading so superior to all
the rest, that he never could come any thing near it. I told him,
You don’t know that: if you were to hear him now, you might
think him even worse than your own imitation of him. We deceive
ourselves as much with respect to the excellences of others as we
do with respect to our own, by dwelling on a favourite idea. In
order to judge, you should ask some one else who remembered him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>I spoke to him about Kemble, whose life he has been lately writing.
I said, when he sat to me for the Richard <span class='fss'>III.</span> meeting the children,
he lent me no assistance whatever in the expression I wished to give,
but remained quite immoveable, as if he were sitting for an ordinary
portrait. Boaden said, This was his way: he never put himself to
any exertion, except in his professional character. If any one wanted
to know his idea of a part or of a particular passage, his reply always
was, “You must come and see me do it.”’</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote then spoke of the boy, as he always calls him (Master
Betty). He asked if I had ever seen him act, and I said, Yes, and
was one of his admirers. He answered, ‘Oh! yes, it was such a
beautiful effusion of natural sensibility; and then that graceful play
of the limbs in youth gave such an advantage over every one about
him. Humphreys (the artist) said, “He had never seen the little
Apollo off the pedestal before.” You see the same thing in the boys
at Westminster-School. But no one was equal to him.’ Mr.
Northcote alluded with pleasure to his unaffected manners when a
boy, and mentioned as an instance of his simplicity, his saying one
day, ‘If they admire me so much, what would they say to Mr.
Harley?’ (a tragedian in the same strolling company with himself.)
We then spoke of his acting since he was grown up. Northcote
said, ‘He went to see him one night with Fuseli, in <cite>Alexander the
Great</cite>, and that he observed coming out, they could get nobody to
do it better.’—‘Nor so well,’ said Fuseli. A question being put,
‘Why then could he not succeed at present?’—‘Because,’ said
Northcote, ‘the world will never admire twice. The first surprise
was excited by his being a boy; and when that was over, nothing
could bring them back again to the same point, not though he had
turned out a second Roscius. They had taken a surfeit of their idol,
and wanted something new. Nothing he could do could astonish
them so much the second time, as the youthful prodigy had done the
first time; and therefore he must always appear as a foil to himself,
and seem comparatively flat and insipid. Garrick kept up the fever
of public admiration as long as any body; but when he returned to
the stage after a short absence, no one went to see him. It was the
same with Sir Joshua: latterly Romney drew all his sitters from
him. So they say the Exhibition is worse every year, though it is
just the same, there are the same subjects and the same painters.
Admiration is a forced tribute, and to extort it from mankind
(envious and ignorant as they are) they must be taken unawares.’
I remarked—‘It was the same in books; if an author was only equal
to himself, he was always said to fall off. The blow to make the
same impression must be doubled, because we are prepared for it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>We give him the whole credit of his first successful production,
because it was altogether unexpected; but if he does not rise as
much above himself in the second instance, as the first was above
nothing, we are disappointed and say he has fallen off, for our feelings
are not equally excited.’—‘Just,’ said Northcote, ‘as in painting
a portrait: people are surprised at the first sitting, and wonder to see
how you have got on: but I tell them they will never see so much
done again; for at first there was nothing but a blank canvas to work
upon, but afterwards you have to improve upon your own design, and
this at every step becomes more and more difficult. It puts me in
mind of an observation of Opie’s, that it was wrong to suppose that
people went on improving to the last in any art or profession: on the
contrary, they put their best ideas into their first works (which they
have been qualifying themselves to undertake all their lives before);
and what they gain afterwards in correctness and refinement, they
lose in originality and vigour.’ I assented to this as a very striking
and (as I thought) sound remark. He said, ‘I wish you had known
Opie: he was a very original-minded man. Mrs. Siddons used to
say—“I like to meet Mr. Opie; for then I always hear something
I did not know before.” I do not say that he was always right;
but he always put your thoughts into a new track, that was worth
following. I was very fond of Opie’s conversation; and I remember
once when I was expressing my surprise at his having so little of the
Cornish dialect; “Why,” he said, “the reason is, I never spoke at
all till I knew you and Wolcott.” He was a true genius. Mr. —
is a person of great judgment; but I do not learn so much from him.
I think this is the difference between sense and genius;—a man of
genius judges for himself, and you hear nothing but what is original
from him: but a man of sense or with a knowledge of the world,
judges as others do; and he is on this account the safest guide to
follow, though not, perhaps, the most instructive companion. I
recollect Miss Reynolds making nearly the same observation. She
said—“I don’t know how it is; I don’t think Miss C— a very
clever woman, and yet, whenever I am at a loss about any thing, I
always go to consult her, and her advice is almost sure to be right.”
The reason was, that this lady, instead of taking her own view of the
subject (as a person of superior capacity might have been tempted to
do) considered only what light others would view it in, and pronounced
her decision according to the prevailing rules and maxims
of the world. When old Dr. — married his housemaid, Sterne,
on hearing of it, exclaimed, “Ay, I always thought him a genius,
and now I’m sure of it!” The truth was (and this was what
Sterne meant), that Dr. — saw a thousand virtues in this woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>which nobody else did, and could give a thousand reasons for his
choice, that no one about him had the wit to answer: but nature
took its usual course, and the event turned out as he had been forewarned,
according to the former experience of the world in such
matters. His being in the wrong did not prove him to be less a
genius, though it might impeach his judgment or prudence. He
was, in fact, wiser, and saw more of the matter than any one of his
neighbours, who might advise him to the contrary; but he was not
so wise as the collective experience or common sense of mankind on
the subject, which his more cautious friends merely echoed. It is
only the man of genius who has any right or temptation to make a
fool of himself, by setting up his own unsupported decision against
that of the majority. He feels himself superior to any individual in
the crowd, and therefore rashly undertakes to act in defiance of the
whole mass of prejudice and opinion opposed to him. It is safe and
easy to travel in a stage-coach from London to Salisbury: but it
would require great strength, boldness, and sagacity to go in a straight
line across the country.’</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE THIRD</h4>

<p class='c009'>Northcote began by saying, ‘You don’t much like Sir Joshua, I
know; but I think that is one of your prejudices. If I was to compare
him with Vandyke and Titian, I should say that Vandyke’s
portraits are like pictures (very perfect ones, no doubt), Sir Joshua’s
like the reflection in a looking-glass, and Titian’s like the real people.
There is an atmosphere of light and shade about Sir Joshua’s, which
neither of the others have in the same degree, together with a vagueness
that gives them a visionary and romantic character, and makes
them seem like dreams or vivid recollections of persons we have seen.
I never could mistake Vandyke’s for any thing but pictures, and I go
up to them to examine them as such: when I see a fine Sir Joshua,
I can neither suppose it to be a mere picture nor a man; and I almost
involuntarily turn back to ascertain if it is not some one behind me
reflected in the glass: when I see a Titian, I am riveted to it, and I
can no more take my eye off from it, than if it were the very
individual in the room. That,’ he said, ‘is, I think, peculiar to
Titian, that you feel on your good behaviour in the presence of his
keen-looking heads, as if you were before company.’ I mentioned
that I thought Sir Joshua more like Rembrandt than like either
Titian or Vandyke: he enveloped objects in the same brilliant haze
of a previous mental conception.—‘Yes,’ he said; ‘but though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Sir Joshua borrowed a great deal, he drew largely from himself: or
rather, it was a strong and peculiar feeling of nature working in him
and forcing its way out in spite of all impediments, and that made
whatever he touched his own. In spite of his deficiency in drawing,
and his want of academic rules and a proper education, you see this
breaking out like a devil in all his works. It is this that has stamped
him. There is a charm in his portraits, a mingled softness and force,
a grasping at the end with nothing harsh or unpleasant in the means,
that you will find nowhere else. He may go out of fashion for a
time: but you must come back to him again, while a thousand
imitators and academic triflers are forgotten. This proves him to
have been a real genius. The same thing, however, made him a
very bad master. He knew nothing of rules which are alone to be
taught; and he could not communicate his instinctive feeling of
beauty or character to others. I learnt nothing from him while I
was with him: and none of his scholars (if I may except myself)
ever made any figure at all. He only gave us his pictures to copy.
Sir Joshua undoubtedly got his first ideas of the art from Gandy,
though he lost them under Hudson; but he easily recovered them
afterwards. That is a picture of Gandy’s there (pointing to a
portrait of a little girl). If you look into it, you will find the same
broken surface and varying outline, that was so marked a characteristic
of Sir Joshua. There was nothing he hated so much as a distinct
outline, as you see it in Mengs and the French school. Indeed, he
ran into the opposite extreme; but it is one of the great beauties of
art to show it waving and retiring, now losing and then recovering
itself again, as it always does in nature, without any of that stiff,
edgy appearance, which only pedants affect or admire. Gandy was
never out of Devonshire: but his portraits are common there. His
father was patronized by the Duke of Ormond, and one reason why
the son never came out of his native county was, that when the Duke
of Ormond was implicated in the rebellion to restore the Pretender
in 1715, he affected to be thought too deep in his Grace’s confidence
and a person of too much consequence to venture up to London, so
that he chose to remain in a voluntary exile.’ I asked Northcote if
he remembered the name of Stringer at the Academy, when he first
came up to town. He said he did, and that he drew very well, and
once put the figure for him in a better position to catch the foreshortening.
He inquired if I knew any thing about him, and I said
I had once vainly tried to copy a head of a youth by him admirably
drawn and coloured, and in which he had attempted to give the effect
of double vision by a second outline accompanying the contour of the
face and features. Though the design might not be in good taste, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>was executed in a way that made it next to impossible to imitate. I
called on him afterwards at his house at Knutsford, where I saw
some spirited comic sketches in an unfinished state,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a> and a capital
female figure by Cignani. All his skill and love of art had, I found,
been sacrificed to his delight in Cheshire ale and the company of
country-squires. Tom Kershaw, of Manchester, used to say, that
he would rather have been Dan Stringer than Sir Joshua Reynolds
at twenty years of age. Kershaw, like other North-country critics,
thought more of the executive power than of the <em>æsthetical</em> faculty;
forgetting that it signifies comparatively little how well you execute
a thing, if it is not worth executing.—In consequence of something
that was said of the egotism of artists, he observed, ‘I am sometimes
thought cold and cynical myself; but I hope it is not from any such
over-weening opinion of myself. I remember once going with Wilkie
to Angerstein’s, and because I stood looking and said nothing, he
seemed dissatisfied, and said, “I suppose you are too much occupied
with admiring, to give me your opinion?” And I answered hastily,
“No, indeed! I was saying to myself, ‘And is this all that the
art can do?’” But this was not, I am sure, an expression of
triumph, but of mortification at the defects which I could not help
observing even in the most accomplished works. I knew they were
the best, but I could have wished them to be a hundred times better
than they were.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote mentioned a conceited painter of the name of Edwards,
who went with Romney to Rome; and when they got into the
Sistine Chapel, turning round to him, said, ‘’Egad! George, we’re
bit!’—He then spoke of his own journey to Rome, of the beauty of
the climate, of the manners of the people, of the imposing effect of
the Roman Catholic religion, of its favourableness to the fine arts,
of the churches full of pictures, of the manner in which he passed his
time, studying and looking into all the rooms in the Vatican: he had
no fault to find with Italy, and no wish to leave it. ‘Gracious and
sweet was all he saw in her!’ As he talked, he looked as if he saw
the different objects pass before him, and his eye glittered with
familiar recollections. He said, Raphael did not scorn to look out
of himself or to be beholden to others. He took whole figures from
Masaccio to enrich his designs, because all he wanted was to advance
the art and ennoble human nature. After he saw Michael Angelo,
he improved in freedom and breadth; and if he had lived to see
Titian, he would have done all he could to avail himself of his
colouring. All his works are an effusion of the sweetness and dignity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>of his own character. He did not know how to make a picture;
but for the conduct of the fable and the development of passion and
feeling (noble but full of tenderness) there is nobody like him. This
is why Hogarth can never come into the lists. He does not lift
us above ourselves: our curiosity may be gratified by seeing what
men are, but our pride must be soothed by seeing them made better.
Why else is Milton preferred to Hudibras, but because the one
aggrandises our notions of human nature, and the other degrades it?
Who will make any comparison between a Madona  of Raphael and a
drunken prostitute by Hogarth? Do we not feel more respect for
an inspired Apostle than for a blackguard in the streets? Raphael
points out the highest perfection of which the human form and
faculties are capable, and Hogarth their lowest degradation or most
wretched perversion. Look at his attempts to paint the good or
beautiful, and you see how faint the impressions of these were in his
mind. Yet these are what every one must wish to cherish in his
own bosom, and must feel most thankful for to those who lend him
the powerful assistance of their unrivalled conceptions of true grandeur
and beauty. Sir Joshua strove to do this in his portraits, and this it
was that raised him in public estimation; for we all wish to get rid
of defects and peculiarities as much as we can. He then said of
Michael Angelo, he did not wonder at the fame he had acquired.
You are to consider the state of the art before his time, and that he
burst through the mean and little manner even of such men as
Leonardo da Vinci and Pietro Perugino and through the trammels
that confined them, and gave all at once a gigantic breadth and
expansion that had never been seen before, so that the world were
struck with it as with a display of almost supernatural power, and
have never ceased to admire since. We are not to compare it with
the examples of art that have followed since, and that would never
have existed but for him, but with those that preceded it. He found
fault with the figure of the flying monk in the St. Peter Martyr, as
<em>fluttering</em> and theatrical, but agreed with me in admiring this picture
and in my fondness for Titian in general. He mentioned his going
with Prince Hoare and Day to take leave of some fine portraits of
Titian’s that hung in a dark corner of a Gallery at Naples; and as
Day looked at them for the last time with tears in his eyes, he said
‘Ah! he was a fine old <em>mouser</em>!’—I said, I had repeated this
expression (which I had heard him allude to before) somewhere in
writing, and was surprised that people did not know what to make of
it. Northcote said, ‘Why, that is exactly what I should have
thought. There is the difference between writing and speaking.
In writing, you address the average quantity of sense or information in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>the world; in speaking, you pick your audience, or at least know
what they are prepared for, or else previously explain what you think
necessary. <em>You</em> understand the epithet because you have seen a great
number of Titian’s pictures, and know that cat-like, watchful,
penetrating look he gives to all his faces, which nothing else
expresses, perhaps, so well as the phrase Day made use of: but the
world in general know nothing of this; all they know or believe is,
that Titian is a great painter like Raphael or any other famous person.
Suppose any one was to tell you, Raphael was a fine old mouser:
would you not laugh at this as absurd? And yet the other is equally
nonsense or incomprehensible to them. No, there is a limit, a conversational
licence which you cannot carry into writing. This is one
difficulty I have in writing: I do not know the point of familiarity
at which I am to stop; and yet I believe I have ideas, and you say I
know how to express myself in talking.’</p>

<p class='c013'>I inquired if he remembered much of Johnson, Burke, and that
set of persons? He said, Yes, a good deal, as he had often seen
them. Burke came into Sir Joshua’s painting-room one day, when
Northcote, who was then a young man, was sitting for one of the
children in Count Ugolino. (It is the one in profile with the hand to
the face.) He was introduced as a pupil of Sir Joshua’s, and, on
his looking up, Mr. Burke said, ‘Then I see that Mr. Northcote is
not only an artist, but has a head that would do for Titian to paint.’—Goldsmith
and Burke had often violent disputes about politics;
the one being a staunch Tory, and the other at that time a Whig
and outrageous anti-courtier. One day he came into the room,
when Goldsmith was there, full of ire and abuse against the late
king, and went on in such a torrent of the most unqualified invective
that Goldsmith threatened to leave the room. The other, however,
persisted; and Goldsmith went out, unable to bear it any longer.
So much for Mr. Burke’s pretended consistency and uniform loyalty!
When Northcote first came to Sir Joshua, he wished very much to
see Goldsmith; and one day Sir Joshua, on introducing him, asked
why he had been so anxious to see him? ‘Because,’ said Northcote,
‘he is a <em>notable</em><a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a> man.’ This expression, <em>notable</em>, in its ordinary
sense, was so contrary to Goldsmith’s character, that they both burst
out a-laughing very heartily. Goldsmith was two thousand pounds
in debt at the time of his death, which was hastened by his chagrin
and distressed circumstances: and when ‘She Stoops to Conquer’
was performed, he was so choked all dinner-time that he could not
swallow a mouthful. A party went from Sir Joshua’s to support it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>The present title was not fixed upon till that morning. Northcote
went with Ralph, Sir Joshua’s man, into the gallery, to see how it
went off; and after the second act, there was no doubt of its success.
Northcote says, people had a great notion of the literary parties at
Sir Joshua’s. He once asked Lord B— to dine with Dr. Johnson
and the rest; but though a man of rank and also of good information,
he seemed as much alarmed at the idea as if you had tried to force
him into one of the cages at Exeter-’Change. Northcote remarked
that he thought people of talents had their full share of admiration.
He had seen young ladies of quality, Lady Marys and Lady
Dorothys, peeping into a room where Mrs. Siddons was sitting, with
all the same timidity and curiosity as if it were some preternatural
being—he was sure more than if it had been the Queen. He then
made some observations on the respect paid to rank, and said,
‘However ridiculous it might seem, it was no more than the natural
expression of the highest respect in other cases. For instance, as to
that of bowing out of the King’s presence backwards, would you not
do the same if you were introduced to Dr. Johnson for the first
time? You would contrive not to turn your back upon him, till you
were out of the room.’ He said, ‘You violent politicians make more
rout about royalty than it is worth: it is only the highest place, and
somebody must fill it, no matter who: neither do the persons themselves
think so much of it as you imagine. They are glad to get
into privacy as much as they can. Nor is it a sinecure. The late
King (I have been told) used often to have to sign his name to
papers, and do nothing else for three hours together, till his fingers
fairly ached, and then he would take a walk in the garden, and come
back to repeat the same drudgery for three hours more. So, when
they told Louis <span class='fss'>XV.</span> that if he went on with his extravagance, he
would bring about a Revolution and be sent over to England with a
pension, he merely asked, “Do you think the pension would be a
pretty good one?”’ He noticed the Memoirs of Cardinal de Retz,
and praised them for their extreme vivacity and great insight into
human nature. Once when the mob had besieged the palace, and
the Cardinal was obliged to go and appease them, a brick-bat was
flung at him and knocked him down, and one of the assailants presenting
a bayonet at his throat, he suddenly called out, ‘Oh, you
wretch! if your father could have seen you in this barbarous action,
what would he have said?’ The man immediately withdrew, though,
says the Cardinal, ‘I knew no more of his father than the babe
unborn.’ Northcote then adverted to the talent of players for
drollery and sudden shifts and expedients, and said that by living in
an element of comic invention, they imbibed a portion of it. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>repeated that jest of F. Reynolds, who filled up the blank in a militia
paper that was sent him with the description, ‘Old, lame, and a
coward;’ and another story told of Matthews, the comedian, who
being left in the room with an old gentleman and a little child, and
the former putting the question to it, ‘Well, my dear, which do
you like best, the dog or the cat?’ by exercising his powers of
ventriloquism, made the child seem to answer, ‘I don’t care a d—mn
for either,’—to the utter confusion of the old gentleman, who immediately
took the father to task for bringing up his son in such
profaneness and total want of common humanity.</p>

<p class='c013'>He then returned to the question of the inconsistent and unreasonable
expectations of mankind as to their success in different pursuits,
and answered the common complaint, ‘What a shame it was that
Milton only got thirteen pounds nine shillings and sixpence for
“Paradise Lost.”’ He said, ‘Not at all; he did not write it to
get money, he had gained what he had proposed by writing it, not
thirteen pounds nine shillings and sixpence, but an immortal reputation.
When Dr. Johnson was asked why he was not invited out to
dine as Garrick was, he answered, as if it was a triumph to him,
“Because great lords and ladies don’t like to have their mouths
stopped!” But who <em>does</em> like to have their mouths stopped? Did
he, more than others? People like to be amused in general; but
they did not give him the less credit for wisdom and a capacity to
instruct them by his writings. In like manner, it has been said, that
the King only sought one interview with Dr. Johnson; whereas, if
he had been a buffoon or a sycophant, he would have asked for
more. No, there was nothing to complain of: it was a compliment
paid by rank to letters, and once was enough. The King was more
afraid of this interview than Dr. Johnson was; and went to it as a
school-boy to his task. But he did not want to have this trial
repeated every day, nor was it necessary. The very jealousy of his
self-love marked his respect: and if he had thought less of Dr.
Johnson, he would have been more willing to risk the encounter.
They had each their place to fill, and would best preserve their self-respect,
and perhaps their respect for each other, by remaining in their
proper sphere. So they make an outcry about the Prince leaving
Sheridan to die in absolute want. He had left him long before: was
he to send every day to know if he was dying? These things cannot
be helped, without exacting too much of human nature.’ I agreed to
this view of the subject, and said,—I did not see why literary people
should repine if they met with their deserts in their own way, without
expecting to get rich; but that they often got nothing for their pains
but unmerited abuse and party obloquy.—‘Oh, it is not party-spite,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>said he, ‘but the envy of human nature. Do you think to distinguish
yourself with impunity? Do you imagine that your superiority will
be delightful to others? Or that they will not strive all they can,
and to the last moment, to pull you down? I remember myself once
saying to Opie, how hard it was upon the poor author or player to
be hunted down for not succeeding in an innocent and laudable
attempt, just as if they had committed some heinous crime! And he
answered, “They <em>have</em> committed the greatest crime in the eyes of
mankind, that of pretending to a superiority over them!” Do you
think that party abuse, and the running down particular authors is any
thing new? Look at the manner in which Pope and Dryden were
assailed by a set of reptiles. Do you believe the modern periodicals
had not their prototypes in the party-publications of that day?
Depend upon it, what you take for political cabal and hostility is
(nine parts in ten) private pique and malice oozing out through those
authorized channels.’</p>

<p class='c013'>We now got into a dispute about nicknames; and H—me coming
in and sitting down at my elbow, my old pugnacious habit seemed to
return upon me. Northcote contended, that they had always an
appropriate meaning: and I said,—‘Their whole force consisted in
their having absolutely none but the most vague and general.’—‘Why,’
said Northcote, ‘did my father give me the name of “Fat
Jack,” but because I was lean?’ He gave an instance which I
thought made against himself, of a man at Plymouth, a baker by profession,
who had got the name of <em>Tiddydoll</em>—he could not tell how.
‘Then,’ said I, ‘it was a name without any sense or meaning.’—‘Be
that as it may,’ said Northcote, ‘it almost drove him mad. The
boys called after him in the street, besieged his shop-windows; even
the soldiers took it up, and marched to parade, beating time with
their feet, and repeating, <em>Tiddydoll, Tiddydoll</em>, as they passed by his
door. He flew out upon them at the sound with inextinguishable
fury, and was knocked down and rolled in the kennel, and got up in
an agony of rage and shame, his white clothes covered all over with
mud. A gentleman, a physician in the neighbourhood, one day
called him in and remonstrated with him on the subject. He advised
him to take no notice of his persecutors. “What,” he said, “does
it signify? Suppose they were to call me <em>Tiddydoll</em>?”—“There,”
said the man, “you called me so yourself; you only sent for me in to
insult me!” and, after heaping every epithet of abuse upon him, flew
out of the house in a most ungovernable passion.’ I told Northcote
this was just the thing I meant. Even if a name had confessedly
no meaning, by applying it constantly and by way of excellence to
another, it seemed as if he must be an abstraction of insignificance:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>whereas, if it pointed to any positive defect or specific charge, it was at
least limited to the one, and you stood a chance of repelling the other.
The virtue of a nickname consisted in its being indefinable and baffling
all proof or reply. When H—me was gone, Northcote extolled his
proficiency in Hebrew, which astonished me not a little, as I had
never heard of it. I said, he was a very excellent man, and a good
specimen of the character of the old Presbyterians, who had more of
the idea of an attachment to principle, and less of an obedience to
fashion or convenience, from their education and tenets, than any other
class of people. Northcote assented to this statement, and concluded
by saying, that H—me was certainly a very good man, and had no
fault but that of not being fat.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE FOURTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>Northcote said, he had been reading Kelly’s ‘Reminiscences.’ I
asked what he thought of them? He said, they were the work of a
well meaning man, who fancied all those about him good people, and
every thing they uttered clever. I said, I recollected his singing
formerly with Mrs. Crouch, and that he used to give great effect to
some things of sentiment, such as ‘Oh! had I been by fate decreed,’
&amp;c. in <cite>Love in a Village</cite>. Northcote said, he did not much like
him: there was a jerk, a kind of <em>brogue</em> in his singing; though he
had, no doubt, considerable advantages in being brought up with all
the great singers and having performed on all the first stages in Italy.
I said, there was no echo of all that now. ‘No,’ said Northcote, ‘nor
in my time, though I was there just after him. He asked me once,
many years ago, if I had heard of him in Italy, and I said no, though
I excused myself by stating that I had only been at Rome, where the
stage was less an object, the Pope there performing the chief part
himself.’ I answered, that I meant there was no echo of the fine
singing at present in Italy, music being there dead as well as painting,
or reduced to mere screaming, noise and rant. ‘It is odd,’ he said,
‘how their genius seems to have left them. Every thing of that sort
appears to be at present no better than it is with us in a country-town:
or rather it wants the simplicity and rustic innocence, and is more
like the draggle-tailed finery of a lady’s waiting-maid. They have
nothing of their own: all is at second-hand. Did you see Thorwaldsen’s
things while you were there? A young artist brought me
all his designs the other day, as miracles that I was to wonder at and
be delighted with. But I could find nothing in them but repetitions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>of the Antique, over and over, till I was surfeited.’ ‘He would be
pleased at this.’ ‘Why, no! that is not enough: it is easy to
imitate the Antique:—if you want to last, you must invent something.
The other is only pouring liquors from one vessel into another, that
become staler and staler every time. We are tired of the Antique;
yet, at any rate, it is better than the vapid imitation of it. The
world wants something new, and will have it. No matter whether it
is better or worse, if there is but an infusion of new life and spirit, it
will go down to posterity; otherwise, you are soon forgotten. Canova,
too, is nothing for the same reason—he is only a feeble copy of the
Antique; or a mixture of two things the most incompatible, that and
opera-dancing. But there is Bernini; he is full of faults; he has too
much of that florid, redundant, fluttering style, that was objected to
Rubens; but then he has given an appearance of flesh that was never
given before. The Antique always looks like marble, you never for
a moment can divest yourself of the idea; but go up to a statue of
Bernini’s, and it seems as if it must yield to your touch. This excellence
he was the first to give, and therefore it must always remain
with him. It is true, it is also in the Elgin marbles; but they were
not known in his time; so that he indisputably was a genius. Then
there is Michael Angelo; how utterly different from the Antique,
and in some things how superior! For instance, there is his statue
of Cosmo de Medici, leaning on his hand, in the chapel of St.
Lorenzo at Florence; I declare it has that look of reality in it, that
it almost terrifies you to be near it. It has something of the same
effect as the mixture of life and death that is perceivable in wax-work;
though that is a bad illustration, as this last is disagreeable
and mechanical, and the other is produced by a powerful and masterly
conception. It was the same with Handel too: he made music speak
a new language, with a pathos and a power that had never been dreamt
of till his time. Is it not the same with Titian, Correggio, Raphael?
These painters did not imitate one another, but were as unlike as
possible, and yet were all excellent. If excellence were one thing,
they must have been all wrong. Still, originality is not caprice or
affectation; it is an excellence that is always to be found in nature,
but has never had a place in art before. So Romney said of Sir
Joshua, that there was that in his pictures which we had not been
used to see in other painters, but we had seen it often enough in
nature. Give this in your works, and nothing can ever rob you of
the credit of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I was looking into Mandeville since I saw you (I thought I had
lost it, but I found it among a parcel of old books). You may judge
by that of the hold that any thing like originality takes of the world:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>for though there is a great deal that is questionable and liable to very
strong objection, yet they will not give it up, because it is the very
reverse of common-place; and they must go to that source to learn
what can be said on that side of the question. Even if you receive a
shock, you feel your faculties roused by it and set on the alert.
Mankind do not choose to go to sleep.’—I replied, that I thought
this was true, yet at the same time the world seemed to have a
wonderful propensity to admire the trite and traditional. I could
only account for this from a reflection of our self-love. We could
few of us invent, but most of us could imitate and repeat by rote;
and as we thought we could get up and ride in the same jog-trot
machine of learning, we affected to look up to this elevation as the
post of honour. Northcote said, ‘You are to consider that learning
is of great use to society; and though it may not add to the stock, is
a necessary vehicle to transmit it to others. Learned men are the
cisterns of knowledge, not the fountain-heads. They are only wrong
in often claiming respect on a false ground, and mistaking their own
province. They are so accustomed to ring the changes on words
and received notions, that they lose their perception of things. I
remember being struck with this at the time of the Ireland controversy:—only
to think of a man like Dr. Parr going down on his knees
and kissing the pretended Manuscript! It was not that he knew or
cared any thing about Shakspeare (or he would not have been so imposed
upon); he merely worshipped a name, as a Catholic priest worships
the shrine that contains some favourite relic.’ I said, the passages in
Ireland’s play that were brought forward to prove the identity, were
the very thing that proved the contrary; for they were obvious
parodies of celebrated passages in Shakspeare, such as that on death
in <cite>Richard II.</cite>—‘And there the antic sits,’ &amp;c. Now, Shakspeare
never parodied himself; but these learned critics were only struck
with the verbal coincidence, and never thought of the general character
or spirit of the writer. ‘Or without that,’ said Northcote,
‘who that attended to the common sense of the question would not
perceive that Shakspeare was a person who would be glad to dispose
of his plays as soon as he wrote them? If it had been such a man
as Sir Philip Sidney, indeed, he might have written a play at his
leisure, and locked it up in some private drawer at Penshurst, where
it might have been found two hundred years after: but Shakspeare
had no opportunity to leave such precious hoards behind him, nor
place to deposit them in. Tresham made me very mad one day at
Cosway’s, by saying they had found a lock of his hair and a picture;
and Caleb Whitefoord, who ought to have known better, asked me if
I did not think Sheridan a judge, and that <em>he</em> believed in the authenticity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>of the Ireland papers? I said, “Do you bring him as a fair
witness? He wants to fill his theatre, and would write a play
himself, and swear it was Shakspeare’s. He knows better than to
cry <em>stale fish</em>.”’</p>

<p class='c013'>I observed, this was what made me dislike the conversation of
learned or literary men. I got nothing from them but what I already
knew, and hardly that: they poured the same ideas and phrases and
cant of knowledge out of books into my ears, as apothecaries’ apprentices
made prescriptions out of the same bottles; but there were no
new drugs or simples in their <em>materia medica</em>. Go to a Scotch
professor, and he bores you to death by an eternal rhapsody about
rent and taxes, gold and paper-currency, population and capital, and
the Teutonic Races—all which you have heard a thousand times
before: go to a linen-draper in the city, without education but with
common sense and shrewdness, and you pick up something new,
because nature is inexhaustible, and he sees it from his own point of
view, when not cramped and hood-winked by pedantic prejudices.
A person of this character said to me the other day, in speaking of
the morals of foreign nations—‘It’s all a mistake to suppose there
can be such a difference, Sir: the world are, and must be moral; for
when people grow up and get married, they teach their children to be
<em>moral</em>. No man wishes to have them turn out profligate.’ I said I
had never heard this before, and it seemed to me to be putting society
on new rollers. Northcote agreed, it was an excellent observation.
I added, this self-taught shrewdness had its weak sides too. This
same person was arguing that mankind remained much the same, and
always would do so. Cows and horses did not change: and why
then should men? He had forgot that cows and horses do not learn
to read and write.—‘Ay, that was very well too,’ said Northcote;
‘I don’t know but I agree with him rather than with you. I was
thinking of the same thing the other day in looking over an old
Magazine, in which there was a long debate on an Act of Parliament
to license gin-drinking. The effect was quite droll. There was
one person who made a most eloquent speech to point out all the
dreadful consequences of allowing this practice. It would debauch
the morals, ruin the health, and dissolve all the bonds of society, and
leave a poor, puny, miserable, Lilliputian race, equally unfit for peace
or war. You would suppose that the world was going to be at an
end. Why, no! the answer would have been, the world will go on
much the same as before. You attribute too much power to an Act
of Parliament. Providence has not taken its measure so ill as to
leave it to an Act of Parliament to continue or discontinue the
species. If it depended on our wisdom and contrivances whether it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>should last or not, it would be at an end before twenty years!
People are wrong about this; some say the world is getting better,
others complain it is getting worse, when, in fact, it is just the same,
and neither better nor worse.’—What a lesson, I said to myself, for
our pragmatical legislators and idle projectors!</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, I had lately been led to think of the little real progress that
was made by the human mind, and how the same errors and vices
revived under a different shape at different periods, from observing
just the same humour in our Ultra-reformers at present, and in their
predecessors in the time of John Knox. Our modern <em>wiseacres</em> were
for banishing all the fine arts and finer affections, whatever was
pleasurable and ornamental, from the Commonwealth, on the score of
utility, exactly as the others did on the score of religion. The real
motive in either case was nothing but a sour, envious, malignant
disposition, incapable of enjoyment in itself, and averse to every
appearance or tendency to it in others. Our peccant humours broke
out and formed into what Milton called ‘a crust of formality’ on the
surface; and while we fancied we were doing God or man good service,
we were only indulging our spleen, self-opinion, and self-will, according
to the fashion of the day. The existing race of free-thinkers and
sophists would be mortified to find themselves the counterpart of the
monks and ascetics of old; but so it was. The dislike of the Westminster
Reviewers to polite literature was only the old exploded
Puritanic objection to human learning. Names and modes of opinion
changed, but human nature was much the same.—‘I know nothing
of the persons you speak of,’ said Northcote; ‘but they must be fools
if they expect to get rid of the showy and superficial, and let only the
solid and useful remain. The surface is a part of nature, and will
always continue so. Besides, how many useful inventions owe their
existence to ornamental contrivances! If the ingenuity and industry
of man were not tasked to produce luxuries, we should soon be
without necessaries. We must go back to the savage state. I
myself am as little prejudiced in favour of poetry as almost any
one can be; but surely there are things in poetry that the world
cannot afford to do without. What is of absolute necessity is only
a part; and the next question is, how to occupy the remainder of
our time and thoughts (not so employed) agreeably and innocently.
Works of fiction and poetry are of incalculable use in this respect.
If people did not read the Scotch novels, they would not read
Mr. Bentham’s philosophy. There is nothing to me more disagreeable
than the abstract idea of a Quaker, which falls under
the same article. They object to colours; and why do they
object to colours? Do we not see that Nature delights in them?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Do we not see the same purpose of prodigal and ostentatious display
run through all her works? Do we not find the most beautiful
and dazzling colours bestowed on plants and flowers, on the plumage
of birds, on fishes and shells, even to the very bottom of the sea?
All this profusion of ornament, we may be sure, is not in vain.
To judge otherwise is to fly in the face of Nature, and substitute
an exclusive and intolerant spirit in the place of philosophy, which
includes the greatest variety of man’s wants and tastes, and makes
all the favourable allowances it can. The Quaker will not wear
coloured clothes; though he would not have a coat to his back if
men had never studied any thing but the mortification of their
appetites and desires. But he takes care of his personal convenience
by wearing a piece of good broad-cloth, and gratifies his vanity, not
by finery, but by having it of a different cut from every body else,
so that he may seem better and wiser than they. Yet this humour,
too, is not without its advantages: it serves to correct the contrary
absurdity. I look upon the Quaker and the fop as two sentinels
placed by Nature at the two extremes of vanity and selfishness,
and to guard, as it were, all the common-sense and virtue that
lie between.’ I observed that these contemptible narrow-minded
prejudices made me feel irritable and impatient. ‘You should not
suffer that,’ said Northcote; ‘for then you will run into the contrary
mistake, and lay yourself open to your antagonist. The monks, for
instance, have been too hardly dealt with—not that I would defend
many abuses and instances of oppression in them—but is it not as
well to have bodies of men shut up in cells and monasteries, as to
let them loose to make soldiers of them and to cut one another’s
throats? And out of that lazy ignorance and leisure, what benefits
have not sprung? It is to them we owe those beautiful specimens
of Gothic architecture which can never be surpassed; many of the
discoveries in medicine and in mechanics are also theirs; and, I
believe, the restoration of classical learning is owing to them. Not
that I would be understood to say that all or a great deal of this
could not have been done without them; but their leisure, their
independence, and the want of some employment to exercise their
minds were the actual cause of many advantages we now enjoy;
and what I mean is, that Nature is satisfied with imperfect instruments.
Instead of snarling at every thing that differs from us
we had better take Shakspeare’s advice, and try to find</p>

<p class='c013'>It was at this time that Mr. Northcote read to me the following

<p class='c013'>I said, the hardest lesson seemed to be to look beyond ourselves.
‘Yes,’ said Northcote, ‘I remember when we were young and
were making remarks upon the neighbours, an old maiden aunt
of ours used to say, “I wish to God you could see yourselves!”
And yet, perhaps, after all, this was not very desirable. Many
people pass their whole lives in a very comfortable dream, who,
if they could see themselves in the glass, would start back with
affright. I remember once being at the Academy, when Sir
Joshua wished to propose a monument to Dr. Johnson in
St. Paul’s, and West got up and said, that the King, he knew,
was averse to any thing of the kind, for he had been proposing a
similar monument in Westminster Abbey for a man of the greatest
genius and celebrity—one whose works were in all the cabinets of
the curious throughout Europe—one whose name they would all
hear with the greatest respect—and then it came out, after a long
preamble, that he meant Woollett, who had engraved his Death of
Wolfe. I was provoked, and I could not help exclaiming—“My
God! what, do you put him upon a footing with such a man as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>Dr. Johnson—one of the greatest philosophers and moralists that
ever lived? We have thousands of engravers at any time!”—and
there was such a burst of laughter at this—Dance, who was a
grave gentlemanly man, laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks;
and Farington used afterwards to say to me, “Why don’t you speak
in the Academy, and begin with ‘My God!’ as you do sometimes?”’
I said, I had seen in a certain painter something of this humour,
who once very good-naturedly showed me a Rubens he had, and
observed with great <em>nonchalance</em>, ‘What a pity that this man wanted
expression!’ I imagined Rubens to have looked round his gallery.
‘Yet,’ he continued, ‘it is the consciousness of defect, too, that
often stimulates the utmost exertions. If Pope had been a fine,
handsome man, would he have left those masterpieces that he has?
But he knew and felt his own deformity, and therefore was
determined to leave nothing undone to extend that corner of power
that he possessed. He said to himself, They shall have no fault
to find there. I have often thought when very good-looking young
men have come here intending to draw, “What! are you going to
bury yourselves in a garret?” And it has generally happened that
they have given up the art before long, and married or otherwise
disposed of themselves.’ I had heard an anecdote of Nelson, that,
when appointed post-captain, and on going to take possession of
his ship at Yarmouth, the crowd on the quay almost jostled him,
and exclaimed—‘What! have they made that little insignificant
fellow a captain? He will do much, to be sure!’ I thought this
might have urged him to dare as he did, in order to get the better
of their prejudices and his own sense of mortification. ‘No doubt,’
said Northcote, ‘personal defects or disgrace operate in this way.
I knew an admiral who had got the nickname of “Dirty Dick”
among the sailors, and, on his being congratulated on obtaining some
desperate victory, all he said was, “I hope they’ll call me Dirty
Dick no more!”—There was a Sir John Grenville or Greenfield
formerly, who was appointed to convoy a fleet of merchant-ships,
and had to defend them against a Spanish man-of-war, and did so
with the utmost bravery and resolution, so that the convoy got safe
off; but after that, he would not yield till he was struck senseless
by a ball, and then the crew delivered up the vessel to the enemy,
who, on coming on board and entering the cabin where he lay,
were astonished to find a mere puny shrivelled spider of a man,
instead of the Devil they had expected to see. He was taken on
shore in Spain, and died of his wounds there; and the Spanish
women afterwards used to frighten their children, by telling them
“Don John of the Greenfield was coming!”’</p>

  <h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE FIFTH</h4>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Northcote mentioned the death of poor —, who had been with
him a few days before, laughing and in great spirits; and the next
thing he heard was that he had put an end to himself. I asked if
there was any particular reason? He said ‘No; that he had left
a note upon the table, saying that his friends had forsaken him,
that he knew no cause, and that he was tired of life. His patron,
C—, of the Admiralty, had, it seems, set him to paint a picture
of Louis the Eighteenth receiving the Order of the Garter. He
had probably been teazed about that. These insipid court-subjects
were destined to be fatal to artists. Poor Bird had been employed
to paint a picture of Louis the Eighteenth landing at Calais, and
had died of chagrin and disappointment at his failure. Who could
make any thing of such a figure and such a subject? There was
nothing to be done; and yet if the artist added any thing of his
own, he was called to order by his would-be patrons, as falsifying
what appeared to them an important event in history. It was
only a person like Rubens who could succeed in such subjects by
taking what licences he thought proper, and having authority enough
to dictate to his advisers.’ A gentleman came in, who asked if
— was likely to have succeeded in his art? Northcote answered,
‘There were several things against it. He was good-looking, good-natured,
and a wit. He was accordingly asked out to dine, and
caressed by those who knew him; and a young man after receiving
these flattering marks of attention and enjoying the height of luxury
and splendour, was not inclined to return to his painting-room, to
brood over a design that would cost him infinite trouble, and the
success of which was at last doubtful. Few young men of agreeable
persons or conversation turned out great artists. It was easier to look
in the glass than to make a dull canvas shine like a lucid mirror; and,
as to talking, Sir Joshua used to say, a painter should sew up his
mouth. It was only the love of distinction that produced eminence;
and if a man was admired for one thing, that was enough. We only
work out our way to excellence by being imprisoned in defects. It
requires a long apprenticeship, great pains, and prodigious self-denial,
which no man will submit to, except from necessity, or as the only
chance he has of escaping from obscurity. I remember when Mr.
Locke (of Norbury Park) first came over from Italy; and old Dr.
Moore, who had a high opinion of him, was crying up his drawings
and asked me, if I did not think he would make a great painter?
I said, ‘No, never!’—‘Why not?’—‘Because he has six thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>a year.’ No one would throw away all the advantages and indulgences
this ensured him, to shut himself up in a garret to pore over that
which after all may expose him to contempt and ridicule. Artists,
to be sure, have gone on painting after they have got rich, such as
Rubens and Titian, and indeed Sir Joshua; but then it had by this
time become a habit and a source of pleasure instead of a toil to them,
and the honours and distinction they had acquired by it counter-balanced
every other consideration. Their love of the art had
become greater than their love of riches or of idleness: but at first
this is not the case, and the repugnance to labour is only mastered by
the absolute necessity for it. People apply to study only when they
cannot help it. No one was ever known to succeed without this
stimulus.’ I ventured to say that, generally speaking, no one, I
believed, ever succeeded in a profession without great application; but
that where there was a strong turn for any thing, a man in this sense
could not help himself, and the application followed of course, and
was, in fact, comparatively easy. Northcote turned short round upon
me, and said, ‘Then you admit original genius? I cannot agree with
you there.’ I said, ‘Waiving that, and not inquiring how the
inclination comes, but early in life a fondness, a passion for a certain
pursuit is imbibed; the mind is haunted by this object, it cannot rest
without it (any more than the body without food), it becomes the
strongest feeling we have, and then, I think, the most intense
application follows naturally, just as in the case of a love of money or
any other passion—the most unremitting application without this is
forced and of no use; and where this original bias exists, no other
motive is required.’—‘Oh! but,’ said Northcote, ‘if you had to
labour on by yourself without competitors or admirers, you would
soon lay down your pencil or your pen in disgust. It is the hope of
shining, or the fear of being eclipsed, that urges you on. Do you
think if nobody took any notice of what you did, this would not damp
your ardour?’—‘Yes; after I had done anything that I thought
worth notice, it might considerably: but how many minds (almost
all the great ones) were formed in secresy and solitude, without knowing
whether they should ever make a figure or not! All they knew
was, that they liked what they were about, and gave their whole souls to
it. There was Hogarth, there was Correggio: what enabled these artists
to arrive at the perfection in their several ways, which afterwards
gained them the attention of the world? Not the premature applause
of the by-standers, but the vivid tingling delight with which the one
seized upon a grotesque incident or expression—“the wrapt soul
sitting in the eyes,” of the other, as he drew a saint or angel from the
skies. If they had been brought forward very early, before they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>served this thorough apprenticeship to their own minds (the opinion of
the world apart), it might have damped or made coxcombs of them.
It was the love and perception of excellence (or the favouring smile
of the Muse) that in my view produced excellence and formed the
man of genius. Some, like Milton, had gone on with a great work
all their lives with little encouragement but the hope of posthumous
fame.’—‘It is not that,’ said Northcote; ‘you cannot see so far.
It is not those who have gone before you or those who are to come
after you, but those who are by your side, running the same race, that
make you look about you. What made Titian jealous of Tintoret?
Because he stood immediately in his way, and their works were compared
together. If there had been a hundred Tintorets a thousand
miles off, he would not have cared about them. That is what takes
off the edge and stimulus of exertion in old age: those who were our
competitors in early life, whom we wished to excel or whose good
opinion we were most anxious about, are gone, and have left us in a
manner by ourselves, in a sort of new world, where we know and are
as little known as on entering a strange country. Our ambition is
cold with the ashes of those whom we feared or loved. I remember
old Alderman Boydell using an expression which explained this.
Once when I was in the coach with him, in reply to some compliment
of mine on his success in life, he said, “Ah! there was one who
would have been pleased at it; but <em>her</em> I have lost!” The fine
coach and all the city-trappings were nothing to him without his wife,
who remembered what he was and the gradations and anxious cares
by which he rose to his present affluence, and was a kind of monitor
to remind him of his former self and of the different vicissitudes of
his fortune.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote then spoke of old Alderman Boydell with great regret,
and said, ‘He was a man of sense and liberality, and a true patron of
the art. His nephew, who came after him, had not the same
capacity, and wanted to dictate to the artists what they were to do.
N. mentioned some instance of his wanting him to paint a picture on
a subject for which he was totally unfit, and figures of a size which
he had never been accustomed to, and he told him “he must get
somebody else to do it.”’ I said, ‘Booksellers and editors had the
same infirmity, and always wanted you to express their ideas, not
your own. Sir R. P— had once gone up to Coleridge, after
hearing him talk in a large party, and offered him “nine guineas a
sheet for his conversation!” He calculated that the “nine guineas
a sheet” would be at least as strong a stimulus to his imagination as the
wasting his words in a room full of company.’ <span class='sc'>Northcote</span>: ‘Ay,
he came to me once, and wished me to do a work which was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>contain a history of art in all countries and from the beginning of the
world. I said it would be an invaluable work if it could be done;
but that there was no one alive who could do it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote afterwards, by some transition, spoke of the characters
of women, and asked my opinion. I said, ‘All my metaphysics
leaned to the vulgar side of these questions: I thought there was a
difference of original genius, a difference in the character of the sexes,
&amp;c. Women appeared to me to do some things better than men;
and therefore I concluded they must do other things worse.’
Northcote mentioned Annibal Caracci, and said, ‘How odd it was,
that in looking at any work of his, you could swear it was done by a
man! Ludovico Caracci had a finer and more intellectual expression,
but not the same bold and workmanlike character. There was Michael
Angelo again—what woman would ever have thought of painting the
figures in the Sistine chapel? There was Dryden too, what a
thorough manly character there was in his style! And Pope’—[I
interrupted, ‘seemed to me between a man and a woman.’]—‘It
was not,’ he continued, ‘that women were not often very clever
(cleverer than many men), but there was a point of excellence which
they never reached. Yet the greatest pains had been taken with
several. Angelica Kauffmann had been brought up from a child to
the art, and had been taken by her father (in boy’s clothes) to the
Academy to learn to draw; but there was an effeminate and feeble
look in all her works, though not without merit. There was not the
man’s hand, or what Fuseli used to call a “fist” in them; that is,
something coarse and clumsy enough, perhaps, but still with strength
and muscle. Even in common things, you would see a carpenter
drive a nail in a way that a women never would; or if you had a
suit of clothes made by a woman, they would hang quite loose about
you and seem ready to fall off. Yet it is extraordinary too, said
Northcote, that in what has sometimes been thought the peculiar
province of men, courage and heroism, there have been women fully
upon a par with any men, such as Joan of Arc and many others, who
have never been surpassed as leaders in battle.’ I observed that of
all the women I had ever seen or known any thing of, Mrs. Siddons
struck me as the grandest. He said,—‘Oh! it is her outward form,
which stamps her so completely for tragedy, no less than the mental
part. Both she and her brother were cut out by Nature for a tragedy-king
and queen. It is what Mrs. Hannah More has said of her,
“<em>Her’s is the afflicted!</em>”’ I replied, that she seemed to me equally
great in anger or in contempt or in any stately part as she was in
grief, witness her Lady Macbeth. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘that, to be sure,
was a masterpiece.’ I asked what he thought of Mrs. Inchbald?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>He said, ‘Oh! very highly: there was no affectation in her. I once
took up her <cite>Simple Story</cite> (which my sister had borrowed from the
circulating library) and looking into it, I said, “My God! what have
you got here?” and I never moved from the chair till I had finished
it. Her <cite>Nature and Art</cite> is equally fine—the very marrow of genius.’
She seems to me, I added, like Venus writing books. ‘Yes, women
have certainly been successful in writing novels; and in plays too. I
think Mrs. Centlivre’s are better than Congreve’s. Their letters,
too, are admirable: it is only when they put on the breeches and
try to write like men, that they become pedantic and tiresome. In
giving advice, too, I have often found that they excelled; and when
I have been irritated by any trifling circumstance and have laid more
stress upon it than it was worth, they have seen the thing in a right
point of view and tamed down my asperities.’ On this I remarked,
that I thought, in general, it might be said that the faculties of women
were of a passive character. They judged by the simple effect upon
their feelings, without inquiring into causes. Men had to act;
women had the coolness and the advantages of by-standers, and were
neither implicated in the theories nor passions of men. While we
were proving a thing to be wrong, they would feel it to be ridiculous.
I said, I thought they had more of common sense, though less of
acquired capacity than men. They were freer from the absurdities
of creeds and dogmas, from the virulence of party in religion and
politics (by which we strove to show our sense and superiority), nor
were their heads so much filled with the lumber of learned folios. I
mentioned as an illustration, that when old Baxter (the celebrated
casuist and nonconformist divine) first went to Kidderminster to preach,
he was almost pelted by the women for maintaining from the pulpit
the then fashionable and orthodox doctrine, that ‘Hell was paved
with infants’ skulls.’ The theory, which the learned divine had piled
up on arguments and authorities, is now exploded: the common-sense
feeling on the subject, which the women of that day took up in
opposition to it as a dictate of humanity, would be now thought the
philosophical one. ‘Yes,’ said Northcote, ‘but this exploded doctrine
was knocked down by some man, as it had been set up by one: the
women would let things remain as they are, without making any progress
in error or wisdom. We do best together: our strength and our
weakness mutually correct each other.’ Northcote then read me
from a manuscript volume lying by him, a character drawn of his
deceased wife by a Dissenting Minister (a Mr. Fox, of Plymouth)
which is so beautiful that I shall transcribe it here.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Written by Mr. John Fox, on the death of his wife, who was
the daughter of the Rev. Mr. Isaac Gelling.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>‘My dear wife died to my unspeakable grief, Dec. 19th, 1762.
With the loss of my dear companion died all the pleasure of my life;
and no wonder: I had lived with her forty years, in which time
nothing happened to abate the strictness of our Friendship, or to
create a coolness or indifference so common and even unregarded by
many in the world. I thank God I enjoyed my full liberty, my
health, such pleasures and diversions as I liked, perfect peace and
competence during the time; which were all seasoned and heightened
every day more or less by constant marks of friendship, most inviolable
affection, and a most cheerful endeavour to make my life agreeable.
Nothing disturbed me but her many and constant disorders; under
all which I could see how her faithful heart was strongly attached to
me. And who could stand the shock of seeing the attacks of Death
upon and then her final dissolution? The consequences to me were
fatal. Old age rushed upon me like an armed man: my appetite
failed, my strength was gone, every amusement became flat and dull;
my countenance fell, and I have nothing to do but to drag on a heavy
chain for the rest of my life; which I hope a good God will enable
me to do without murmuring, and in conclusion, to say with all my
soul—</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Mr. John Fox died 22d of October, 1763. He was born
May 10th, 1693.’</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE SIXTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>Northcote alluded to a printed story of his having hung an early
picture of H—’s out of sight, and of Fuseli’s observing on the
occasion—‘By G—d, you are sending him to heaven before his
time!’ He said there was not the least foundation for this story;
nor could there be, he not having been <em>hanger</em> that year. He read
out of the same publication a letter from Burke to a young artist of
the name of Barrow, full of excellent sense, advising him by no
means to give up his profession as an engraver till he was sure he
could succeed as a painter, out of idle ambition and an unfounded
contempt for the humbler and more laborious walks of life. ‘I could
not have thought it of him,’ said Northcote; ‘I confess he never
appeared to me so great a man.’ I asked what kind of looking man
he was? Northcote answered, ‘You have seen the picture? There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>was something I did not like; a thinness in the features, and an
expression of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hauteur</span></i>, though mixed with condescension and the
manners of a gentleman. I can’t help thinking he had a hand in
the Discourses; that he gave some of the fine, graceful turns; for
Sir Joshua paid a greater deference to him than to any body else, and
put up with freedoms that he would only have submitted to from
some peculiar obligation. Indeed, Miss Reynolds used to complain
that whenever any of Burke’s poor Irish relations came over, they
were all poured in upon them to dinner; but Sir Joshua never took
any notice, but bore it all with the greatest patience and tranquillity.
To be sure, there was another reason: he expected Burke to write
his Life, and for this he would have paid almost any price. This
was what made him submit to the intrusions of Boswell, to the
insipidity of Malone, and to the magisterial dictation of Burke: he
made sure that out of these three one would certainly write his Life,
and ensure him immortality that way. He thought no more of the
person who actually did write it afterwards than he would have suspected
his dog of writing it. Indeed, I wish he could have known;
for it would have been of some advantage to me, and he might have
left me something not to dwell on his defects; though he was as free
from them as any man; but you can make any one ridiculous with
whom you live on terms of intimacy.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘I remember an instance of this that happened with respect to old
Mr. M— whom you must have heard me speak of, and who was
esteemed an idol by Burke, Dr. Johnson, and many others. Sir
Joshua wanted to reprint his Sermons and prefix a Life to them, and
asked me to get together any particulars I could learn of him. So I
gave him a manuscript account of Mr. M—, written by an old
school-fellow of his (Mr. Fox, a dissenting minister in the West of
England); after which I heard no more of the Life. Mr. M—
was in fact a man of extraordinary talents and great eloquence; and
by representing in a manner the High-Church notions both of
Dr. Johnson and Sir Joshua (for both were inclined the same way)
they came to consider him as a sort of miracle of virtue and wisdom.
There was, however, something in Mr. Fox’s plain account that
would strike Sir Joshua, for he had an eye for nature; and he would
at once perceive it was nearer the truth than Dr. Johnson’s pompous
character of him, which was proper only for a tombstone—it was
like one of Kneller’s portraits,—it would do for any body! That,’
said Northcote, ‘is old Mr. M—’s definition of beauty, which Sir
Joshua has adopted in the Discourses—that it is the <em>medium of form</em>.
For what is a handsome nose? A long nose is not a handsome nose;
neither is a short nose a handsome one: it must then be one that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>neither long nor short, but in the middle between both. Even Burke
bowed to his authority; and Sir Joshua thought him the wisest man
he ever knew. Once when Sir Joshua was expressing his impatience
of some innovation, and I said, “At that rate, the Christian Religion
could never have been established.” “Oh!” he said, “Mr. M—
has answered that!” which seemed to satisfy him.’</p>

<p class='c013'>I made some remark that I wondered he did not come up to
London, though the same feeling seemed to belong to other clever
men born in Devonshire (as Gandy) whose ambition was confined to
their native county, so that there must be some charm in the place.
‘You are to consider,’ he replied, ‘it is almost a peninsula, so that
there is no thorough-fare, and people are therefore more stationary in
one spot. It is for this reason they necessarily intermarry among
themselves, and you can trace the genealogies of families for centuries
back; whereas in other places, and particularly here in London,
where every thing of that kind is jumbled together, you never know
who any man’s grandfather was. There are country-squires and
plain gentry down in that part of the world, who have occupied the
same estates long before the Conquest (as the Suckbitches in particular,—not
a very sounding name) and who look down upon the Courtneys
and others as upstarts. Certainly, Devonshire for its extent has produced
a number of eminent men, Sir Joshua, the Mudges, Dunning,
Gay, Lord Chancellor King, Raleigh, Drake, and Sir Richard
Granville in Queen Elizabeth’s time, who made that gallant defence
in an engagement with the Spanish fleet, and was the ancestor of
Pope’s Lord Lansdowne, “What Muse for Granville will refuse to
sing, &amp;c.” Foster, the celebrated preacher, was also, I believe,
from the West of England. He first became popular from the Lord
Chancellor Hardwicke stopping in the porch of his chapel in the Old
Jewry, out of a shower of rain; and thinking he might as well hear
what was going on, he went in, and was so well pleased that he sent
all the great folks to hear him, and he was run after as much as Irving
has been in our time. An old fellow-student from the country, going
to wait on him at his house in London, found a Shakspeare on the
window-seat; and remarking the circumstance with some surprise as
out of the usual course of clerical studies, the other apologised by
saying that he wished to know something of the world, that his
situation and habits precluded him from the common opportunities,
and that he found no way of supplying the deficiency so agreeable
or effectual as looking into a volume of Shakspeare. Pope has
immortalised him in the well-known lines:—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>Dr. Mudge, the son of Mr. Zachary Mudge, who was a physician,
was an intimate friend of my father’s, and I remember him perfectly
well. He was one of the most delightful persons I ever knew.
Every one was enchanted with his society. It was not wit that he
possessed, but such perfect cheerfulness and good-humour, that it was
like health coming into the room. He was a most agreeable companion,
quite natural and unaffected. His reading was the most
beautiful I have ever heard. I remember his once reading Moore’s
fable of the <cite>Female Seducers</cite> with such feeling and sweetness that
every one was delighted, and Dr. Mudge himself was so much
affected that he burst into tears in the middle of it. The family are
still respectable, but derive their chief lustre from the first two
founders, like clouds that reflect the sun’s rays, after he has sunk
below the horizon, but in time turn grey and are lost in obscurity!’</p>

<p class='c013'>I asked Northcote if he had ever happened to meet with a letter of
Warburton’s in answer to one of Dr. Doddridge’s, complimenting
the author of the <cite>Divine Legation of Moses</cite> on the evident zeal and
earnestness with which he wrote—to which the latter candidly
replied, that he wrote with great haste and unwillingness; that he
never sat down to compose till the printer’s boy was waiting at the
door for the manuscript, and that he should never write at all but as a
relief to a morbid lowness of spirits, and to drive away uneasy thoughts
that often assailed him.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a> ‘That indeed,’ observed Northcote, ‘gives
a different turn to the statement; I thought at first it was only the
common coquetry both of authors and artists, to be supposed to do
what excites the admiration of others with the greatest ease and
indifference, and almost without knowing what they are about. If
what surprises <em>you</em> costs them nothing, the wonder is so much
increased. When Michael Angelo proposed to fortify his native
city, Florence, and he was desired to keep to his painting and
sculpture, he answered, that those were his recreations, but what he
really understood was architecture. That is what Sir Joshua considers
as the praise of Rubens, that he seemed to make a play-thing of the
art. In fact, the work is never complete unless it has this appearance:
and therefore Sir Joshua has laid himself open to criticism, in saying
that ‘a picture must not only be done well, it must seem to have been
done easily.’ It cannot be said to be done well, unless it has this
look. That is the fault of those laboured and timid productions of
the modern French and Italian schools; they are the result of such a
tedious, petty, mechanical process, that it is as difficult for you to
admire as it has been for the artist to execute them. Whereas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>when a work seems stamped on the canvas by a blow, you are taken
by surprise; and your admiration is as instantaneous and electrical as
the impulse of genius which has caused it. I have seen a whole-length
portrait by Velasquez, that seemed done while the colours were
yet wet; every thing was touched in, as it were, by a wish; there
was such a power that it thrilled through your whole frame, and you
felt as if you could take up the brush and do any thing. It is this
sense of power and freedom which delights and communicates its
own inspiration, just as the opposite drudgery and attention to details
is painful and disheartening. There was a little picture of one of the
Infants of Spain on horseback, also by Velasquez, which Mr. Agar
had,<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a> and with which Gainsborough was so transported, that he said
in a fit of bravado to the servant who showed it, “Tell your master
I will give him a thousand pounds for that picture.” Mr. Agar
began to consider what pictures he could purchase with the money if
he parted with this, and at last, having made up his mind, sent
Gainsborough word he might have the picture; who not at all
expecting this result, was a good deal confused, and declared,
however he might admire it, he could not afford to give so large
a sum for it.’</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE SEVENTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>Northcote complained of being unwell, though he said he could
hardly expect it to be otherwise at his age. He must think of
making up the accounts of his life, such as it had been, though he
added (checking himself) that he ought not to say that, for he had
had his share of good as well as others. He had been reading in
Boccaccio, where it was frequently observed, that ‘such a one
departed this <em>wretched</em> life at such a time;’—so that in Boccaccio’s
time they complained of the wretchedness of life as much as we do.
He alluded to an expression of Coleridge’s, which he had seen
quoted in a newspaper, and which he thought very fine, ‘That an old
Gothic cathedral always seemed to him like a petrified religion!’
Some one asked, Why does he not go and turn Black Monk?
Because, I said, he never does anything that he should do. ‘There
are some things,’ said N., ‘with respect to which I am in the same
state that a blind man is as to colours. Homer is one of these.
I am utterly in the dark about it. I can make nothing of his heroes
or his Gods. Whether this is owing to my not knowing the language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>or to a change of manners, I cannot say.’ He was here interrupted
by the entrance of the beautiful Mrs. G—, beautiful even in years.
She said she had brought him a book to look at. She could not
stop, for she had a lady waiting for her below, but she would call in
some morning and have a long chat. After she was gone, I remarked
how handsome she still was; and he said, ‘I don’t know why she is
so kind as to come, except that I am the last link in the chain that
connects her with all those she most esteemed when she was young,
Johnson, Reynolds, Goldsmith—and remind her of the most delightful
period of her life.’ I said, Not only so, but you remember what she
was at twenty; and you thus bring back to her the triumphs of her
youth—that pride of beauty which must be the more fondly cherished
as it has no external vouchers, and lives chiefly in the bosom of its
once lovely possessor. In her, however, the Graces had triumphed
over time; she was one of Ninon de l’Enclos’ people, of the list of
the Immortals. I could almost fancy the shade of Goldsmith in the
room, looking round with complacency. ‘Yes,’ said Northcote,
‘that is what Sir Joshua used to mention as the severest test of
beauty—it was not then <em>skin-deep</em> only. She had gone through all
the stages, and had lent a grace to each. There are beauties that are
old in a year. Take away the bloom and freshness of youth, and
there is no trace of what they were. Their beauty is not grounded
in first principles. Good temper is one of the great preservers of the
features.’ I observed, it was the same in the mind as in the body.
There were persons of premature ability who soon ran to seed, and
others who made no figure till they were advanced in life. I had
known several who were very clever at seventeen or eighteen, but
who had turned out nothing afterwards. ‘That is what my father
used to say, that at that time of life the effervescence and intoxication
of youth did a great deal, but that we must wait till the gaiety and
dance of the animal spirits had subsided to see what people really
were. It is wonderful’ (said Northcote, reverting to the former
subject) ‘what a charm there is in those early associations, in whatever
recals that first dawn and outset of life. <cite>Jack-the-Giant-Killer</cite> is the
first book I ever read, and I cannot describe the pleasure it gives me
even now. I cannot look into it without my eyes filling with tears.
I do not know what it is (whether good or bad), but it is to me,
from early impressions, the most heroic of performances. I remember
once not having money to buy it, and I transcribed it all out with my
own hand. This is what I was going to say about Homer. I
cannot help thinking that one cause of the high admiration in which
it is held is its being the first book that is put into the hands of young
people at school: it is the first spell which opens to them the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>enchantments of the unreal world. Had I been bred a scholar,
I dare say Homer would have been my Jack-the-Giant-Killer!—There
is an innocence and simplicity in that early age which makes
every thing relating to it delightful. It seems to me that it is the
absence of all affectation or even of <em>consciousness</em>, that constitutes the
perfection of nature or art. That is what makes it so interesting to
see girls and boys dancing at school—there is such natural gaiety and
freedom, such unaffected, unpretending, unknown grace. That is
the true dancing, and not what you see at the Opera. And again, in
the most ordinary actions of children, what an ease, what a playfulness,
what flames of beauty do they throw out without being in the
smallest degree aware of it! I have sometimes thought it a pity
there should be such a precious essence, and that those who possess
it should be quite ignorant of it: yet if they knew it, that alone
would kill it! The whole depends on the utter absence of all
egotism, of the remotest reflection upon self. It is the same in works
of art—the simplest are the best. That is what makes me hate those
<em>stuffed</em> characters that are so full of themselves that I think they
cannot have much else in them. A man who admires himself
prevents me from admiring him, just as by praising himself he stops
my mouth; though the vulgar take their cue from a man’s opinion
of himself, and admire none but coxcombs and pedants. This is
the best excuse for impudence and quackery, that the world will not
be gained without it. The true favourites of Nature, however, have
their eyes turned towards the Goddess, instead of looking at themselves
in the glass. There is no pretence or assumption about them.
It seems difficult indeed for any one who is the object of attention
to others not to be thinking of himself: but the greatest men have
always been the most free from this bias, the weakest have been the
soonest puffed up by self-conceit. If you had asked Correggio why he
painted as he did, he would have answered, “Because he could not
help it.” Look at Dryden’s verses, which he wrote just like a
school-boy who brings up his task without knowing whether he shall
be rewarded or flogged for it. Do you suppose he wrote the description
of Cymon for any other reason than because he could not help
it, or that he had any more power to stop himself in his headlong
career than the mountain-torrent? Or turn to Shakspeare, who
evidently does not know the value, the <em>dreadful</em> value (as I may say)
of the expressions he uses. Genius gathers up its beauties, like the
child, without knowing whether they are weeds or flowers: those
productions that are destined to give forth an everlasting odour, grow
up without labour or design.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. P— came in, and complimenting Northcote on a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>picture he was about, the latter said, It was his last great work: he
was getting too old for such extensive undertakings. His friend
replied, that Titian went on painting till near a hundred. ‘Aye,’
said Northcote, ‘but he had the Devil to help him, and I have
never been able to retain him in my service. It is a dreadful thing to
see an immense blank canvas spread out before you to commit sins
upon.’ Something was said of the Academy, and P— made
answer, ‘I know your admiration of corporate bodies.’ N. said,
‘They were no worse than others; they all began well and ended
ill. When the Academy first began, one would suppose that the
Members were so many angels sent from heaven to fill the different
situations, and that was the reason why it began: now the difficulty
was to find any body fit for them, and the deficiency was supplied by
interest, intrigue, and cabal. Not that I object to the individuals
neither. As Swift said, I like Jack, Tom, and Harry very well by
themselves; but altogether, they are not to be endured. We see
the effect of people acting in concert in animals (for men are only a
more vicious sort of animals): a single dog will let you kick and cuff
him as you please, and will submit to any treatment; but if you meet
a pack of hounds, they will set upon you and tear you to pieces with
the greatest impudence.’ P.: ‘The same complaint was made of the
Academy in Barry’s time, which is now thirty or forty years ago.’<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
<span class='sc'>Northcote</span>: ‘Oh! yes, they very soon degenerated. It is the same
in all human institutions. The thing is, there has been no way found
yet to keep the Devil out. It will be a curious thing to see whether
that experiment of the American Government will last. If it does,
it will be the first instance of the kind.’ P.: ‘I should think not.
There is something very complicated and mysterious in the mode of
their Elections, which I am given to understand are managed in an
under-hand manner by the leaders of parties; and besides, in all
governments the great <em>desideratum</em> is to combine activity with a freedom
from selfish passions. But it unfortunately happens that in human
life, the selfish passions are the strongest and most active; and on this
rock society seems to split. There is a certain period in a man’s life
when he is at his best (when he combines the activity of youth with
the experience of manhood), after which he declines; and perhaps it
may be the same with states. Things are not best in the beginning
or at the end, but in the middle, which is but a point.’ <span class='sc'>Northcote</span>:
‘Nothing stands still; it therefore either grows better or worse.
When a thing has reached its utmost perfection, it then borders on
excess; and excess leads to ruin and decay.’</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Lord G. had bought a picture of Northcote’s: an allusion was
made to his enormous and increasing wealth. Northcote said he
could be little the better for it. After a certain point, it became a
mere nominal distinction. He only thought of that which passed
through his hands and fell under his immediate notice. He knew no
more of the rest than you or I did: he was merely perplexed by it.
This was what often made persons in his situation tenacious of the
most trifling sums, for this was the only positive or tangible wealth
they had: the remote contingency was like a thing in the clouds, or
mountains of silver and gold seen in the distant horizon. It was the
same with Nollekens: he died worth £200,000: but the money he
had accumulated at his banker’s was out of his reach and contemplation—<em>out
of sight, out of mind</em>—he was only muddling about with
what he had in his hands, and lived like a beggar in actual fear of
want. P. said, he was an odd little man, but he believed clever in
his profession. Northcote assented, and observed ‘he was an instance
of what might be done by concentrating the attention on a single
object. If you collect the rays of the sun in a focus, you could set
any object on fire. Great talents were often dissipated to no
purpose: but time and patience conquered every thing. Without
them, you could do nothing. So Giardini, when asked how long it
would take to learn to play on the fiddle, answered—“Twelve hours
a-day for twenty years together.” A few great geniuses may trifle
with the arts, like Rubens; but in general nothing can be more fatal
than to suppose one’s-self a great genius.’ P. observed, that in
common business those who gave up their whole time and thoughts
to any pursuit generally succeeded in it, though far from bright men:
and we often found those who had acquired a name for some one
excellence, people of moderate capacity in other respects. After
Mr. P. was gone, Northcote said he was one of the persons of the
soundest judgment he had ever known, and like Mr. P. H. the least
liable to be imposed upon by appearances. Northcote made the
remark that he thought it improper in any one to refuse lending a
favourite picture for public exhibition, as it seemed not exclusively
to belong to one person. A jewel of this value belongs rather to
the public than to the individual. Consider the multitudes you
deprive of an advantage they cannot receive again: the idle of amusement,
the studious of instruction and improvement. I said, this
kind of indifference to the wishes of the public was <em>sending the world
to Coventry</em>! We then spoke of a celebrated courtier, of whom I
said I was willing to believe every thing that was amiable, though
I had some difficulty, while thinking of him, to keep the <em>valet</em> out
of my head. <span class='sc'>Northcote</span>: ‘He has certainly endeavoured to behave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>well; but there is no altering character. I myself might have been
a courtier if I could have cringed and held my tongue; but I could
no more exist in that element than a fish out of water. At one time
I knew Lord R. and Lord H. S—, who were intimate with the
Prince and recommended my pictures to him. Sir Joshua once
asked me, “What do you know of the Prince of —, that he so
often speaks to me about you?” I remember I made him laugh by
my answer, for I said, “Oh! he knows nothing of me, nor I of
him—it’s only his <em>bragging</em>!”—“Well,” said he, “that is spoken
like a King!”‘... It was to-day I asked leave to write down
one or two of these Conversations: he said ‘I might, if I thought
it worth while; but I do assure you that you overrate them. You
have not lived enough in society to be a judge. What is new to
you, you think will seem so to others. To be sure, there is one
thing, I have had the advantage of having lived in good society
myself. I not only passed a great deal of my younger days in the
company of Reynolds, Johnson, and that circle, but I was brought
up among the Mudges, of whom Sir Joshua (who was certainly used
to the most brilliant society of the metropolis) thought so highly,
that he had them at his house for weeks, and even sometimes gave
up his own bed-room to receive them. Yet they were not thought
superior to several other persons at Plymouth, who were distinguished,
some for their satirical wit, others for their delightful fancy, others for
their information or sound sense, and with all of whom my father was
familiar when I was a boy. Really after what I recollect of these,
some of the present people appear to me mere wretched pretenders,
muttering out their own emptiness.’ I said, We had a specimen of
Lord Byron’s <cite>Conversations</cite>. <span class='sc'>Northcote.</span>—‘Yes; but he was a tyrant,
and a person of that disposition never learns any thing, because he will
only associate with inferiors. If, however, you think you can make
any thing of it and can keep clear of personalities, I have no objection
to your trying; only I think after the first attempt, you will give it
up as turning out quite differently from what you expected.’</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE EIGHTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>Northcote spoke again of Sir Joshua, and said, he was in some
degree ignorant of what might be called the <em>grammatical</em> part of the
art, or scholarship of academic skill; but he made up for it by an
eye for nature, or rather by a feeling of harmony and beauty. Dance
(he that was afterwards Sir Nathaniel Holland) drew the figure
well, gave a strong likeness and a certain studied air to his portraits;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>yet they were so stiff and forced that they seemed as if put into a
<em>vice</em>. Sir Joshua, with the defect of proportion and drawing, threw
his figures into such natural and graceful attitudes, that they might
be taken for the very people sitting or standing there. An arm
might be too long or too short, but from the apparent ease of the
position he had chosen, it looked like a real arm and neither too
long nor too short. The mechanical measurements might be wrong:
the general conception of nature and character was right; and this,
which he felt most strongly himself, he conveyed in a corresponding
degree to the spectator. Nature is not one thing, but a variety of
things, considered under different points of view; and he who seizes
forcibly and happily on any one of these, does enough for fame.
He will be the most popular artist, who gives that view with which
the world in general sympathise. A merely professional reputation
is not very extensive, nor will it last long. W—, who prided
himself on his drawing, had no idea of any thing but a certain rigid
<em>outline</em>, never considering the use of the limbs in moving, the effects
of light and shade, &amp;c. so that his figures, even the best of them, look
as if cut out of wood. Therefore no one now goes to see them:
while Sir Joshua’s are as much sought after as ever, from their
answering to a feeling in the mind, though deficient as literal representations
of external nature. Speaking of artists who were said, in
the cant of connoisseurship, to be jealous of their outline, he said,
‘Rembrandt was not one of these. He took good care to lose it as
fast as he could.’ Northcote then spoke of the breadth of Titian,
and observed, that though particularly in his early pictures, he had
finished highly and copied every thing from nature, this never interfered
with the general effect, there was no confusion or littleness:
he threw such a broad light on the objects, that every thing was seen
in connection with the masses and in its place. He then mentioned
some pictures of his own, some of them painted forty years ago, that
had lately sold very well at a sale at Plymouth: he was much
gratified at this, and said it was almost like looking out of the grave
to see how one’s reputation got on.</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote told an anecdote of Sir George B—, to show the
credulity of mankind. When a young man, he put an advertisement
in the papers to say that a Mynheer —, just come over from
Germany, had found out a method of taking a likeness much superior
to any other by the person’s looking into a mirror and having the
glass heated so as to bake the impression. He stated this wonderful
artist to live at a perfumer’s shop in Bond-street, opposite to an hotel
where he lodged, and amused himself the next day to see the numbers
of people who flocked to have their likenesses taken in this surprising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>manner. At last, he went over himself to ask for Monsieur —,
and was driven out of the shop by the perfumer in a rage, who said
there was no Monsieur — nor Monsieur <em>Devil</em> lived there. At
another time Sir G. was going in a coach to a tavern with a party of
gay young men. The waiter came to the coach-door with a light,
and as he was holding this up to the others, those who had already got
out went round, and getting in at the opposite coach-door came out
again, so that there seemed to be no end of the procession, and the
waiter ran into the house, frightened out of his wits. The same story
is told of Swift and four clergymen dressed in canonicals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Speaking of titles, Northcote said, ‘It was strange what blunders
were often made in this way. R—, (the engraver) had stuck
Lord John Boringdon under his print after Sir Joshua—it should be
John Lord Boringdon—and he calls the Earl of Carlisle Lord
Carlisle—Lord Carlisle denotes only a Baron. I was once dining
at Sir John Leicester’s, and a gentleman who was there was expressing
his wonder what connection a Prince of Denmark and a Duke
of Gloucester could have with Queen Anne, that prints of them
should be inserted in a history that he had just purchased of her
reign. No other, I said, than that one of them was her son, and the
other her husband. The boy died when he was eleven years old
of a fever caught at a ball dancing, or he would have succeeded to
the throne. He was a very promising youth, though that indeed is
what is said of all princes. Queen Anne took his death greatly to
heart, and that was the reason why she never would appoint a successor.
She wished her brother to come in, rather than the present family.
That makes me wonder, after thrones have been overturned and kingdoms
torn asunder to keep the Catholics out, to see the pains that are
now taken to bring them in. It was this that made the late King say
it was inconsistent with his Coronation-oath. Not that I object to
tolerate any religion (even the Jewish), but they are the only one
that will not tolerate any other. They are such devils (what with
their cunning, their numbers, and their zeal), that if they once
get a footing, they will never rest till they get the whole power
into their hands. It was but the other day that the Jesuits nearly
overturned the empire of China; and if they were obliged to make
laws and take the utmost precautions against their crafty encroachments,
shall we open a door to them, who have only just escaped out
of their hands?’ I said, I had thrown a radical reformer into a
violent passion lately by maintaining that the Pope and Cardinals of
Rome were a set of as good-looking men as so many Protestant
Bishops or Methodist parsons, and that the Italians were the only
people who seemed to have any faith in their religion as an object of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>imagination or feeling. My opponent grew almost black in the face,
while inveighing against the enormous absurdity of transubstantiation;
it was in vain I pleaded the beauty, innocence, and cheerfulness of
the peasant-girls near Rome, who believed in this dreadful superstition,
and who thought me <em>damned</em> and would probably have been glad
to see me burnt at a stake as a heretic. At length I said, that I
thought reason and truth very excellent things in themselves; and
that when I saw the rest of the world grow as fond of them as they
were of absurdity and superstition, I should be entirely of his way of
thinking; but I liked an interest in something (a wafer or a crucifix)
better than an interest in nothing. What have philosophers gained
by unloosing their hold of the <em>ideal</em> world, but to be hooted at and
pelted by the rabble, and envied and vilified by one another for want
of a common bond of union and interest between them? I just now
met the son of an old literary friend in the street, who seemed disposed
to <em>cut</em> me for some hereditary pique, jealousy, or mistrust.
Suppose his father and I had been Catholic priests (saving the <em>bar-sinister</em>)
how different would have been my reception! He is short-sighted
indeed; but had I been a Cardinal, he would have seen me
fast enough: the costume alone would have assisted him. Where
there is no frame-work of respectability founded on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>
and on public opinion cemented into a prejudice, the jarring pretensions
of individuals fall into a chaos of elementary particles, neutralising
each other by mutual antipathy, and soon become the sport and
laughter of the multitude. Where the whole is referred to intrinsic,
real merit, this creates a standard of conceit, egotism, and envy in
every one’s own mind, lowering the class, not raising the individual.
A Catholic priest walking along the street is looked up to as a link
in the chain let down from heaven: a poet or philosopher is looked
down upon as a poor creature, deprived of certain advantages, and
with very questionable pretensions in other respects. Abstract
intellect requires the weight of the other world to be thrown into the
scale, to make it a match for the prejudices, vulgarity, ignorance, and
selfishness of this! ‘You are right,’ said Northcote. ‘It was
Archimedes who said he could move the earth if he had a place
to fix his levers on: the priests have always found this <em>purchase</em> in
the skies. After all, we have not much reason to complain, if they
give us so splendid a reversion to look forward to. That is what I
said to G— when he had been trying to unsettle the opinions of
a young artist whom I knew. Why should you wish to turn him
out of one house, till you have provided another for him? Besides,
what do you know of the matter more than he does? His nonsense
is as good as your nonsense, when both are equally in the dark. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>to what your friend said of the follies of the Catholics, I do not
think that the Protestants can pretend to be quite free from them. So
when a chaplain of Lord Bath’s was teazing a Popish clergyman to
know how he could make up his mind to admit that absurdity of
Transubstantiation, the other made answer, “Why, I’ll tell you:
when I was young, I was taught to swallow Adam’s Apple; and
since that, I have found no difficulty with any thing else!” We may
say what we will of the Catholic religion; but it is more easy to
abuse than to overturn it. I have for myself no objection to it but
its insatiable ambition, and its being such a dreadful engine of power.
It is its very perfection as a system of profound policy and moral
influence, that renders it so formidable. Indeed, I have been sometimes
suspected of a leaning to it myself; and when Godwin wrote
his <cite>Life of Chaucer</cite>, he was said to have turned Papist from his
making use of something I had said to him about confession. I
don’t know but unfair advantages may be taken of it for state-purposes;
but I cannot help thinking it is of signal benefit in the
regulation of private life. If servants have cheated or lied or done
any thing wrong, they are obliged to tell it to the priest, which
makes them bear it in mind, and then a certain penance is assigned
which they must go through, though they do not like it. All this
acts as a timely check, which is better than letting them go on till
their vices get head, and then hanging them! The Great indeed
may buy themselves off (as where are they not privileged?) but this
certainly does not apply to the community at large. I remember
our saying to that old man (a Dominican friar) whose picture you
see there, that we wished he could be made a Royal Confessor; to
which he replied, that he would not for the world be Confessor to a
King, because it would prevent him from the conscientious discharge
of his duty. In former times, in truth, the traffic in indulgences was
carried to great lengths; and this it was that broke up the system
and gave a handle to the Protestants. The excellence of the scheme
produced the power, and then the power led to the abuse of it.
Infidel Popes went the farthest in extending the privileges of the
Church; and being held back by no scruples of faith or conscience,
nearly ruined it. When some pious ecclesiastic was insisting to
Leo <span class='fss'>X.</span> on the necessity of reforming certain scandalous abuses, he
pointed to a crucifix and said, “Behold the fate of a reformer!
The system, as it is, is good enough for us!” They have taken
the morality of the Gospel and engrafted upon it a system of superstition
and priestcraft; but still perhaps the former prevails over the
latter. Even that duty of humanity to animals is beautifully provided
for; for on St. Antony’s day, the patron of animals, the horses, &amp;c.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>pass under a certain arch, and the priest sprinkles the Holy Water
over them, so that they are virtually taken under the protection of
the church. We think we have a right to treat them any how,
because they have no souls. The Roman Catholic is not a barbarous
religion; and it is also much milder than it was. This is a necessary
consequence of the state of things. When three Englishmen were
presented to Benedict <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> (Lambertini) who was a man of wit and
letters, he observed to them smiling, “I know that you must look
upon our religion as false and spurious, but I suppose you will have
no objection to receive the blessing of an old man!” When Fuseli
and I were there, an Englishman of the name of Brown had taken
the pains to convert a Roman artist: the Englishman was sent from
Rome, and the student was taken to the Inquisition, where he was
shown the hooks in the wall and the instruments of torture used in
former times, reprimanded, and soon after dismissed.’ I asked
Northcote whereabouts the Inquisition was? He said, ‘In a street
behind the Vatican.’ He and Mr. Prince Hoare once took shelter
in the portico out of a violent shower of rain, and considered it a
great piece of inhumanity to be turned out into the street. He then
noticed a curious mistake in Mrs. Radcliffe’s <span class='sc'>Italian</span>, where some
one is brought from Naples to the Inquisition, and made to enter
Rome through the Porta di Popolo, and then the other streets on the
English side of Rome are described with great formality, which is
as if any one was described as coming by the coach from Exeter,
and after entering at Whitechapel, proceeding through Cheapside and
the Strand to Charing Cross. Northcote related a story told him
by Nollekens of a singular instance of the effects of passion that he
saw in the Trastevere, the oldest and most disorderly part of Rome.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a>
Two women were quarrelling, when having used the most opprobrious
language, one of them drew a knife from her bosom, and tried to
plunge it into her rival’s breast, but missing her blow and the other
retiring to a short distance and laughing at her, in a fit of impotent
rage she struck it into her own bosom. Her passion had been worked
up to an uncontrolable pitch, and being disappointed of its first object,
must find vent somewhere. I remarked it was what we did every
day of our lives in a less degree, according to the vulgar proverb of
<em>cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face</em>!</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote then returned to the subject of the sale of his pictures. He
said it was a satisfaction, though a melancholy one, to think that one’s
works might fetch more after one’s death than during one’s life-time.
He had once shewn Farington a landscape of Wilson’s, for which a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>gentleman had given three hundred guineas at the first word; and
Farington said he remembered Wilson’s painting it, and how delighted
he was when he got thirty pounds for it. Barrett rode in his coach,
while Wilson nearly starved and was obliged to borrow ten pounds
to go and die in Wales: yet he used to say that his pictures would
be admired, when the name of Barrett was forgotten. Northcote
said he also thought it a great hardship upon authors, that copyright
should be restricted to a few years, instead of being continued for the
benefit of the family, as in the case of Hudibras, Paradise Lost, and
other works, by which booksellers made fortunes every year, though
the descendants of the authors were still living in obscurity and distress.
I said that in France a successful drama brought something to the author
or his heirs every time it was acted. Northcote seemed to approve of
this, and remarked that he always thought it very hard upon Richardson,
just at the time he had brought out his Pamela or Clarissa, to have it
pirated by an Irish bookseller through a treacherous servant whom he
kept in his shop, and thus to lose all the profits of his immortal labours.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE NINTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>Northcote remarked to-day that artists were more particular than
authors as to character—the latter did not seem to care whom they
associated with. He, N—, was disposed to attribute this to greater
refinement of moral perception in his own profession. I said I thought
it was owing to authors being more upon the town than painters, who
were dependent upon particular individuals and in a manner accountable
to them for the persons they might be seen in company with or
might occasionally bring into contact with them. For instance, I
said I thought H— was wrong in asking me to his <em>Private Day</em>,
where I might meet with Lord M—, who was so loyal a man that
he affected not to know that such a person as Admiral Blake had ever
existed. On the same principle this Noble Critic was blind to the
merit of Milton, in whom he could see nothing, though Mr. Pitt
had been at the pains to repeat several fine passages to him. N—
said, ‘It’s extraordinary how particular the world sometimes are, and
what prejudices they take up against people, even where there is no
objection to character, merely on the score of opinion. There is
G—, who is a very good man; yet when Mr. H— and myself
wished to introduce him at the house of a lady who lives in a round of
society, and has a strong tinge of the <em>blue-stocking</em>, she would not hear
of it. The sound of the name seemed to terrify her. It was his
<em>writings</em> she was afraid of. Even Cosway made a difficulty too.’</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>I replied—‘I should not have expected this of him, who
was as great a visionary and as violent a politician as any body
could be.’</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Northcote</span>—‘It passed off in Cosway as whim. He was one of
those butterfly characters that nobody minded: so that his opinion
went for nothing: but it would not do to bring any one else there,
whose opinion might be more regarded and equally unpalatable.
G—’s case is particularly hard in this respect: he is a profligate in
theory, and a bigot in conduct. He does not seem at all to practise
what he preaches, though this does not appear to avail him any thing.’—‘Yes,’
I said, ‘he writes, against himself. He has written against
matrimony, and has been twice married. He has scouted all the
common-place duties, and yet is a good husband and a kind father.
He is a strange composition of contrary qualities. He is a cold
formalist, and full of ardour and enthusiasm of mind; dealing in
magnificent projects and petty cavils; naturally dull, and brilliant by
dint of study; pedantic and playful; a dry logician and a writer of
romances.’</p>

<p class='c013'>‘You describe him,’ said N—, ‘as I remember Baretti once
did Sir Joshua Reynolds at his own table, saying to him, “You are
extravagant and mean, generous and selfish, envious and candid,
proud and humble, a genius and a mere ordinary mortal at the same
time.” I may not remember his exact words, but that was their
effect. The fact was, Sir Joshua was a mixed character, like the
rest of mankind in that respect; but knew his own failings, and was
on his guard to keep them back as much as possible, though the
defects would break out sometimes.’ ‘G—, on the contrary,’
I said, ‘is aiming to let his out and to magnify them into virtues in
a kind of hot-bed of speculation. He is shocking on paper and tame
in reality.’</p>

<p class='c013'>‘How is that?’ said Northcote.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Why, I think it is easy enough to be accounted for; he is
naturally a cold speculative character, and indulges in certain metaphysical
extravagances as an agreeable exercise for the imagination,
which alarm persons of a grosser temperament, but to which he
attaches no practical consequences whatever. So it has been asked
how some very immoral or irreligious writers, such as Helveticus and
others, have been remarked to be men of good moral character? and
I think the answer is the same. Persons of a studious, phlegmatic
disposition can with impunity give a license to their thoughts, which
they are under no temptation to reduce into practice. The sting is
taken out of evil by their constitutional indifference, and they look on
virtue and vice as little more than words without meaning or the black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>and white pieces of the chess-board, in combining which the same
skill and ingenuity may be shewn. More depraved and combustible
temperaments are warned of the danger of any latitude of opinion by
their very proneness to mischief, and are forced by a secret consciousness
to impose the utmost restraint both upon themselves and others.
The greatest prudes are not always supposed to be the greatest
enemies to pleasure. Besides, authors are very much confined by
habit to a life of study and speculation, sow their wild oats in their
books, and unless where their passions are very strong indeed, take
their swing in theory and conform in practice to the ordinary rules
and examples of the world.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote said, ‘Certainly people are tenacious of appearances in
proportion to the depravity of manners, as we may see in the simplicity
of country-places. To be sure, a rake like Hodge in <cite>Love in a
Village</cite> gets amongst them now and then; but in general they do
many gross things without the least notion of impropriety, as if vice
were a thing they had no more to do with than children.’ He then
mentioned an instance of some young country-people who had to
sleep on the floor in the same room and they parted the men from
the women by some sacks of corn, which served for a line of
demarcation and an inviolable partition between them. I told N—
a story of a countrywoman who coming to an inn in the West of
England wanted a bed; and being told they had none to spare, still
persisted till the landlady said in a joke, ‘I tell you, good woman, I
have none, unless you can prevail with the ostler to give you half of
his.’—‘Well,’ said she, ‘if he is a sober, prudent man, I should
not mind.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Something was then said of the manners of people abroad, who
sometimes managed to unite an absence of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise honte</span></i> with what
could hardly be construed into an ignorance of vice. The Princess
Borghese (Buonaparte’s sister) who was no saint, sat to Canova for
a model, and being asked, ‘If she did not feel a little uncomfortable,’
answered, ‘No, there was a fire in the room.’</p>

<p class='c013'>‘Custom,’ said N—, ‘makes a wonderful difference in taking
off the sharpness of the first inflammable impression. People for
instance were mightily shocked when they first heard that the boys
at the Academy drew from a living model. But the effect almost
immediately wears off with them. It is exactly like copying from a
statue. The stillness, the artificial light, the attention to what they
are about, the publicity even, draws off any idle thoughts, and they
regard the figure and point out its defects or beauties, precisely as if
it were of clay or marble.’ I said I had perceived this effect myself,
that the anxiety to copy the object before one deadened every other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>feeling; but as this drew to a close, the figure seemed almost like
something coming to life again, and that this was a very critical
minute. He said, he found the students sometimes watched the
women out, though they were not of a very attractive appearance, as
none but those who were past their prime would sit in this way: they
looked upon it as an additional disgrace to what their profession
imposed upon them, and as something unnatural. One in particular
(he remembered) always came in a mask. Several of the young men
in his time had however been lured into a course of dissipation and
ruined by such connexions; one in particular, a young fellow of great
promise but affected, and who thought that profligacy was a part of
genius. I said, It was the easiest part. This was an advantage
foreign art had over ours. A battered courtesan sat for Sir Joshua’s
Iphigene; innocent girls sat for Canova’s Graces, as I had been
informed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote asked, if I had sent my son to school? I said, I
thought of the Charter-House, if I could compass it. I liked those
old established places where learning grew for hundreds of years,
better than any new-fangled experiments or modern seminaries. He
inquired if I had ever thought of putting him to school on the
Continent; to which I answered, No, for I wished him to have an
idea of home, before I took him abroad; by beginning in the contrary
method, I thought I deprived him both of the habitual attachment to
the one and of the romantic pleasure in the other. N— observed
there were very fine schools at Rome in his time, one was an Italian,
and another a Spanish College, at the last of which they acted plays
of Voltaire’s, such as Zara, Mahomet, &amp;c. at some of which he had
been present. The hall that served for the theatre was beautifully
decorated; and just as the curtain was about to draw up, a hatch-way
was opened and showered down play-bills on their heads with the
names of the actors; such a part being by a Spanish Grandee of the
first class, another by a Spanish Grandee of the second class, and they
were covered with jewels of the highest value. Several Cardinals
were also present (who did not attend the public theatres) and it was
easy to gain admittance from the attention always shewn to strangers.
N— then spoke of the courtesy and decorum of the Roman clergy
in terms of warm praise, and said he thought it in a great measure
owing to the conclave being composed of dignitaries of all nations,
Spanish, German, Italian, which merged individual asperities and
national prejudices in a spirit of general philanthropy and mutual
forbearance. I said I had never met with a look from a Catholic
priest (from the highest to the lowest) that seemed to reproach me
with being a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">tramontane</span></i>. This absence of all impertinence was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>me the first of virtues. He repeated, I have no fault to find with
Italy. There may be vice in Rome, as in all great capitals (though
I did not see it)—but in Parma and the remoter towns, they seem all
like one great and exemplary family. Their kindness to strangers
was remarkable. He said he had himself travelled all the way from
Lyons to Genoa, and from Genoa to Rome without speaking a word
of the language and in the power of a single person without meeting
with the smallest indignity; and everywhere, both at the inns and on
the road, every attention was paid to his feelings, and pains taken to
alleviate the uncomfortableness of his situation. Set a Frenchman
down in England to go from London to York in the same circumstances,
and see what treatment he will be exposed to. He recollected
a person of the name of Gogain who had been educated in France
and could not speak English—on landing, he held out half-a-guinea to
pay the boatman who had rowed him only about twenty yards from
the vessel, which the fellow put in his pocket and left him without a
single farthing. Abroad, he would have been had before the magistrate
for such a thing, and probably sent to the galleys. There is a
qualifying property in nature that makes most things equal. In
England they cannot drag you out of your bed to a scaffold, or take
an estate from you without some reason assigned: but as the law
prevents any flagrant acts of injustice, so it makes it more difficult
to obtain redress. ‘We pay,’ continued Northcote, ‘for every
advantage we possess by the loss of some other. Poor Goblet, the
other day, after making himself a drudge to Nollekens all his life,
with difficulty recovered eight hundred pounds compensation; and
though he was clearly entitled, by the will, to the models which the
sculptor left behind him, he was afraid to risk the law expenses, and
gave it up.’ Some person had been remarking, that every one had a
right to leave his property to whom he pleased. ‘Not,’ said N—,
‘when he has promised it to another.’ I asked if Mr. — was not
the same person I had once seen come into his painting-room, in a
rusty black coat and brown worsted stockings, very much with the
air of a man who carries a pistol in an inside pocket? He said, ‘It
might be: he was a dull man, but a great scholar—one of those
described in the epigram:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oh! ho, quoth Time to Thomas Heame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whatever I forget, you learn.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We then alluded to an attack of Cobbett’s on some spruce legacy-hunter,
quoted in the last Sunday’s Examiner; and N— spoke in
raptures of the power in Cobbett’s writings, and asked me if I had
ever seen him. I said, I had for a short time; that he called <em>rogue</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>and <em>scoundrel</em> at every second word in the coolest way imaginable, and
went on just the same in a room as on paper.</p>

<p class='c013'>I returned to what N— lately said of his travels in Italy, and
asked if there were fine Titians at Genoa or Naples. ‘Oh, yes!’
he said, ‘heaps at the latter place. Titian had painted them for
one of the Farnese family; and when the second son succeeded the
eldest as King of Spain, the youngest, who was Prince of Parma,
went to Naples, and took them with him. There is that fine one
(which you have heard me speak of) of Paul <span class='fss'>III.</span> and his two
natural sons or nephews, as they were called. My God! what
a look it has! The old man is sitting in his chair, and looking
up to one of the sons, with his hands grasping the arm-chair, and
his long spider fingers, and seems to say (as plain as words can
speak), “You wretch! what do you want now?”—while the young
fellow is advancing with an humble hypocritical air. It is true
history, as Fuseli said, and indeed it turned out so; for the son
(or nephew) was afterwards thrown out of the palace-windows by
the mob, and torn to pieces by them.’ In speaking of the different
degrees of information abroad, he remarked, ‘One of the persons
where I lodged at Rome did not even know the family name of the
reigning Pope, and only spoke of him as the <em>Papa</em>; another person,
who was also my landlady, knew all their history, and could tell
me the names of the Cardinals from my describing their coats of
arms to her.’</p>

<p class='c013'>N— related an anecdote of Mr. Moore (brother of the general),
who was on board an English frigate in the American war, and
coming in sight of another vessel which did not answer their signals,
they expected an action, when the Captain called his men together,
and addressed them in the following manner:—‘You dirty, ill-looking
blackguards! do you suppose I can agree to deliver up such a set of
scarecrows as you as prisoners to that smart, frippery Frenchman?
I can’t think of such a thing. No! by G—d, you must fight till
not a man of you is left, for I should be ashamed of owning such
a ragamuffin crew!’ This was received with loud shouts and
assurances of victory, but the vessel turned out to be an English
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>I asked if he had seen the American novels, in one of which (the
Pilot) there was an excellent description of an American privateer
expecting the approach of an English man-of-war in a thick fog,
when some one saw what appeared to be a bright cloud rising over
the fog, but it proved to be the topsail of a seventy-four. N—
thought this was striking, but had not seen the book. ‘Was it one
of I—’s?’ Oh! no, he is a mere trifler—a <em>filigree</em> man—an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>English <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span></i> at second-hand; but the <em>Pilot</em> gave a true and
unvarnished picture of American character and manners. The storm,
the fight, the whole account of the ship’s crew, and in particular of
an old boatswain, were done to the life—every thing</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Suffered a sea-change</div>
      <div class='line'>Into something new and strange.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>On land he did not do so well. The fault of American literature
(when not a mere vapid imitation of ours) was, that it ran too much
into dry, minute, literal description; or if it made an effort to rise
above this ground of matter-of-fact, it was forced and exaggerated,
‘horrors accumulating on horror’s head.’ They had <em>no natural
imagination</em>. This was likely to be the case in a new country like
America, where there were no dim traces of the past—no venerable
monuments—no romantic associations; where all (except the
physical) remained to be created, and where fiction, if they attempted
it, would take as preposterous and extravagant a shape as their local
descriptions were jejune and servile. Cooper’s novels and Brown’s
romances (something on the model of Godwin’s) were the two
extremes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some remark was made on the failure of a great bookseller, and
on the supposition that now we should find out the author of the
Scotch novels. ‘Aye,’ said N—, ‘we shall find more than one.’
I said, I thought not; to say nothing of the beauties, the peculiarities
of style and grammar in every page proved them to be by the same
hand. Nobody else could write so well—or so ill, in point of mere
negligence. N— said, ‘It was a pity he should fling away a
fortune twice. There were some people who could not keep money
when they had got it. It was a kind of incontinence of the purse.
Zoffani did the same thing. He made a fortune in England by his
pictures, which he soon got rid of, and another in India, which went
the same way.’</p>

<p class='c013'>We somehow got from Sir Walter to the Queen’s trial, and the
scenes at Brandenburg House. I said they were a strong illustration
of that instinct of servility—that <em>hankering</em> after rank and power,
which appeared to me to be the base part of human nature. Here
were all the patriots and Jacobins of London and Westminster,
who scorned and hated the King, going to pay their homage to the
Queen, and ready to worship the very rags of royalty. The wives
and daughters of popular caricaturists and of forgotten demagogues
were ready to pull caps in the presence-chamber for precedence, till
they were parted by Mr. Alderman Wood. Every fool must go to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>kiss hands; ‘our maid’s aunt of Brentford’ must sip loyalty from
the Queen’s hand! That was the true court to which <em>they</em> were
admitted: the instant there was the smallest opening, all must rush
in, <em>tag-rag and bobtail</em>. All the fierceness of independence and all the
bristling prejudices of popular jealousy were smoothed down in a
moment by the velvet touch of the Queen’s hand! No matter what
else she was (whether her cause were right or wrong)—it was the
mock-equality with sovereign rank, the acting in a farce of state, that
was the secret charm. That was what drove them mad. The world
must have something to admire; and the more worthless and stupid
their idol is, the better, provided it is fine: for it equally flatters
their appetite for wonder, and hurts their self-love less. This is the
reason why people formerly were so fond of idols: they fell down
and worshipped them, and made others do the same, for theatrical
effect; while, all the while, they knew they were but wood and
stone painted over. We in modern times have got from the <em>dead</em> to
the <em>living</em> idol, and bow to hereditary imbecility. The less of genius
and virtue, the greater our self-complacency. We do not care how
high the elevation, so that it is wholly undeserved. True greatness
excites our envy; mere rank, our unqualified respect. That is the
reason of our antipathy to new-made dynasties, and of our acquiescence
in old-established despotism. We think <em>we</em> could sit upon a throne,
if we had had the good luck to be born to one; but we feel that we
have neither talent nor courage to raise ourselves to one. If any one
does, he seems to have got the start of us; and we are glad to pull
him back again. I remember Mr. R—, of Liverpool (a very
excellent man, and a good patriot,) saying, many years ago, in
reference to Buonaparte and George <span class='fss'>III.</span>, that ‘the superiority of rank
was quite enough for him, without the intellectual superiority.’ That
is what has made so many renegadoes and furious Anti-Buonapartists
among our poets and politicians, because he got before them in the
race of power. N— ‘And the same thing made <em>you</em> stick to him,
because you thought he was your fellow! It is wonderful how much
of our virtues, as well as of our vices, is referable to self. Did you
ever read Rochefoucault?’—Yes. ‘And don’t you think he is
right?’ In a great measure: but I like Mandeville better. He
goes more into his subject. ‘Oh! he is a devil. There is a
description of a clergyman’s hand he has given, which I have always
had in my eye whenever I have had to paint a fine gentleman’s
hand. I thought him too metaphysical, but it is long since I read
him. His book was burnt by the common hangman; was it not?’
Yes; but he did not at all like this circumstance, and is always
recurring to it.—‘No one can like this kind of condemnation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>because every sensible man knows he is not a judge in his own
cause; and besides, is conscious, if the verdict were on the other
side, how ready he would be to catch at it as decisive in his favour.’
I said, it was amusing to see the way in which he fell upon Steele,
Shaftesbury, and other amiable writers, and the terror you were
in for your favourites, just as when a hawk is hovering over and
going to pounce upon some of the more harmless feathered tribe.
He added, ‘It was surprising how Swift had escaped with so little
censure; but the <cite>Gulliver’s Travels</cite> passed off as a story-book, and
you might say in verse what you would be pelted for in plain prose.—The
same thing you have observed in politics may be observed in
religion too. You see the anxiety to divide and bring nearer to our
own level. The Creator of the universe is too high an object for us
to approach; the Catholics therefore have introduced the Virgin
Mary and a host of saints, with whom their votaries feel more at
their ease and on a par. The real object of worship is kept almost
out of sight. Dignum the singer (who is a Catholic) was arguing on
this subject with some one, who wanted to convert him, and he
replied in his own defence—“If you had a favour to ask of some
great person, would you not first apply to a common friend to
intercede for you?”’ In some part of the foregoing conversation,
N— remarked that ‘West used to say, you could always tell
the highest nobility at court, from their profound humility to the
King: the others kept at a distance, and did not seem to care about
it. The more the former raised the highest person, the more they
raised themselves who were next in point of rank. They had a
greater interest in the question; and the King would have a greater
jealousy of them than of others. When B— was painting the
Queen, with whom he used to be quite familiar, he was one day
surprised, when the Prince-Regent came into the room, to see the
profound homage and dignified respect with which he approached
her. “Good God!” said he to himself, “here is the second person
in the kingdom comes into the room in this manner, while I have
been using the greatest freedoms!” To be sure! that was the very
reason: the second person in the kingdom wished to invest the first
with all possible respect, so much of which was naturally reflected
back upon himself. B— had nothing to lose or gain in this game
of royal ceremony, and was accordingly treated as a cypher.’</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>
  <h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE TENTH</h4>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Northcote shewed me a printed circular from the Academy, with
blanks to be filled up by Academicians, recommending young students
to draw. One of these related to an assurance as to the moral character
of the candidate; Northcote said, ‘What can I know about
that? This zeal for morality begins with inviting me to tell a lie.
I know whether he can draw or not, because he brings me specimens
of his drawings; but what am I to know of the moral character
of a person I have never seen before? Or what business have the
Academy to inquire into it? I suppose they are not afraid he will
steal the Farnese Hercules; and as to idleness and debauchery, he
will not be cured of these by cutting him off from the pursuit of a
study on which he has set his mind, and in which he has a fair
chance to succeed. I told one of them, with as grave a face as I
could, that, as to his moral character, he must go to his god-fathers
and god-mothers for that. He answered very simply, that they were
a great way off, and that he had nobody to appeal to but his
apothecary! The Academy is not an institution for the suppression
of vice, but for the encouragement of the Fine Arts. Why then go
out of their way to meddle with what was provided for by other
means—the law and the pulpit? It would not have happened in
Sir Joshua’s time,’ continued Northcote, ‘nor even in Fuseli’s: but
the present men are “dressed in a little brief authority,” and they wish
to make the most of it, without perceiving the limits. No good can
possibly come of this <em>busy-body</em> spirit. The dragging morality into
every thing, in season and out of season, is only giving a handle to
hypocrisy, and turning virtue into a bye-word for impertinence!’</p>

<p class='c013'>Here Northcote stopped suddenly, to ask if there was not such a
word as <em>rivulet</em> in the language? I said it was as much a word in
the language as it was a thing in itself. He replied, it was not to be
found in Johnson; the word was <em>riveret</em> there. I thought this must
be in some of the new editions; Dr. Johnson would have knocked
any body down, who had used the word <em>riveret</em>. It put me in mind
of a story of Y— the actor, who being asked how he was, made
answer that he had been indisposed for some days with a <em>feveret</em>.
The same person, speaking of the impossibility of escaping from too
great publicity, related an anecdote of his being once in a remote part
of the Highlands, and seeing an old gentleman fishing, he went up to
inquire some particulars as to the mode of catching the salmon at
what are called ‘salmon-leaps.’—The old gentleman began his reply—‘Why,
Mr. Y—,’ at which the actor started back in great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>surprise. ‘Good God!’ said Northcote, ‘did he consider this as a
matter of wonder, that, after shewing himself on a stage for a number
of years, people should know his face? If an artist or an author
were recognised in that manner, it might be a proof of celebrity,
because it would shew that they had been sought for; but an actor is
so much seen in public, that it is no wonder he is known by all the
world. I once went with Opie in the stage-coach to Exeter; and
when we parted; he to go on to Cornwall and I to Plymouth, there
was a young gentleman in the coach who asked me, “Who it was
that I had been conversing with?” I said it was Mr. Opie, the
painter; at which he expressed the greatest surprise, and was
exceedingly concerned to think he had not known it before. I did
not tell him who I was, to see if my name would electrify him in the
same manner. That brings to my mind the story I perhaps may
have told you before, of a Mr. A— and Dr. Pennick of the
Museum. They got into some quarrel at the theatre; and the
former presenting his card, said with great pomposity, “My name is
A—, Sir;” to which the other answered, “I hear it, Sir, and
am not terrified!”’ I asked if this was the A— who fought the
duel with F—.  He said he could not tell, but he was our
ambassador to some of the petty German States.</p>

<p class='c013'>A country-gentleman came in, who complimented Northcote on
his pictures of animals and birds, which I knew he would not like.
He muttered something when he was gone, in allusion to the proverb
of <em>giving snuff to a cat</em>. Afterwards, a miniature-painter brought
some copies he had made of a portrait of a young lady by Northcote.
They were really very well, and we learned he was to have five
guineas for the larger size, and two for the smaller ones. I could
now account for the humility and shabby appearance of the artist.
He paid his court better than his rustic predecessor; for being asked
by Northcote if the portrait of the young lady was approved? he said
the mother had told him, before she engaged him to copy it, that ‘it
was one of the <em>loveliest</em> pictures (that was her expression) that had
ever been seen!’ This praise was better relished than that of his
dogs and parrots.</p>

<p class='c013'>I took notice to Northcote that the man had a very good head;
but that he put me in mind of the state and pretensions of the art
before artists wrote <em>Esquire</em> after their names. He said, Yes, he
was like Andrew Taffi, or some of those in Vasari. I observed
how little he was paid for what he really did so well; to which
Northcote merely replied, ‘In all things that are not necessary, those
in the second class must always be miserably paid. Copying pictures
is like plain-work among women, it is what any body can do, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>therefore, nothing but a bare living is to be got by it.’ He added,
that the young lady, whose portrait her family was so anxious to have
copied, was dead, and this was a kind of diversion to their grief. It
was a very natural mode of softening it down; it was still recurring
to the object of their regret, and yet dwelling on it in an agreeable
point of view. ‘The wife of General H—, (he continued) many
years ago, came to me to do a picture of her son, a lieutenant in the
navy, who was killed in battle, but whom I had never seen. There
was no picture of him to go by, but she insisted on my doing one
under her direction. I attempted a profile as the easiest; and she
sat behind me and sang in a soft manner to herself, and told me what
I was to do. It was a wretched business, as you may suppose, being
made out from description; but she would have it to be a great
likeness, and brought all the family and even the servants to see it,
who probably did not dare to be of a different opinion. I said to
her, “What a pity it was Sir Joshua had not done a portrait of him
in his life-time!” At this she expressed great contempt, and
declared she would not give two-pence for all Sir Joshua’s pictures;
indeed, she had one which I was very welcome to have if I chose to
come for it. I lost no time in going to her house, and when I came
there, she led me up into an old garret which was used as a lumber-room,
and taking it carefully out of a shabby frame not worth a groat,
said “There, take it, I am not sorry to get it out of the house.” I
asked what it was that made her so indifferent about this picture?
and she answered, “It was a likeness of a young gentleman who had
been kind enough to die, by which means the estate came to the
General.” She spoke in this unfeeling manner, though her own son
had just died in the same circumstances; and she had had a
monument made for him, and strewed flowers upon it, and made such
a <em>fuss</em> about his death, that she would hardly have known what to do
if he had come to life again!’ I asked what was her reason for
disliking Reynolds’s pictures? ‘Oh! that was her ignorance, she
did not know why!’</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote said, ‘G— called here with his daughter. I asked
her about Lord Byron; she said his temper was so bad that nobody
could live with him. The only way to pass the day tolerably well
with him was to contradict him the first thing in the morning. I
have known tempers of that kind myself; you must quarrel with
them in order to be friends. If you did not conquer them, they
would conquer you.’ Something was observed about Byron and
Tom Paine, as to their attacks upon religion; and I said that sceptics
and philosophical unbelievers appeared to me to have just as little
liberality or enlargement of view as the most bigoted fanatic. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>could not bear to make the least concession to the opposite side.
They denied the argument that because the Scriptures were fine they
were therefore of divine origin, and yet they virtually admitted it; for,
not believing their truth, they thought themselves bound to maintain
that they were good for nothing. I had once, I said, given great
offence to a knot of persons of this description, by contending that
Jacob’s Dream was finer than any thing in Shakspeare; and that
Hamlet would bear no comparison with, at least, one character in the
New Testament. A young poet had said on this occasion, he did not
like the Bible, because there was nothing about flowers in it; and I
asked him if he had forgot that passage, ‘Behold the lilies of the field,’
&amp;c.? ‘Yes,’ said Northcote, ‘and in the Psalms and in the book of
Job, there are passages of unrivalled beauty. In the latter there is the
description of the war-horse, that has been so often referred to, and of
the days of Job’s prosperity; and in the Psalms, I think there is that
passage, “He openeth his hands, and the earth is filled with plenteousness;
he turneth away his face, and we are troubled; he hideth himself,
and we are left in darkness;” or, again, how fine is that
expression, “All the beasts of the forests are mine, and so are the
cattle upon a thousand hills!” What an expanse, and what a grasp of
the subject! Every thing is done upon so large a scale, and yet with
such ease, as if seen from the highest point of view. It has mightily
a look of inspiration or of being dictated by a superior intelligence.
They say mere English readers cannot understand Homer, because
it is a translation; but why will it not bear a translation as well as
the book of Job, if it is as fine? In Shakspeare, undoubtedly, there
is a prodigious variety and force of human character and passion, but
he does not take us out of ourselves; he has a wonderful, almost a
miraculous fellow-feeling with human nature in every possible way,
but that is all. Macbeth is full of sublimity, but the sublimity is
that of the earth, it does not reach to heaven. It is a still stronger
objection that is made to Hogarth; he, too, gave the incidents and
characters of human life with infinite truth and ability; but then it
was in the lowest forms of all, and he could not rise even to common
dignity or beauty. There is a faculty that enlarges and beautifies
objects, even beyond nature. It is for this reason that we must,
reluctantly perhaps, give the preference to Milton over Shakspeare;
for his Paradise (to go no further) is certainly a scene of greater
beauty and happiness, than was ever found on earth, though so vividly
described that we easily make the transition, and transport ourselves
there. It is the same difference that there is between Raphael and
Michael Angelo, though Raphael, too, in many of his works merited
the epithet of <em>divine</em>.’—I mentioned some lines from Shakspeare I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>had seen quoted in a translation of a French work, and applied to
those who adhered to Buonaparte in his misfortunes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>—He that can endure</div>
      <div class='line'>To follow with allegiance a fallen lord,</div>
      <div class='line'>Does conquer him that did his master conquer,</div>
      <div class='line'>And earns a place i’ the story.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I said I was struck to see how finely they came in. ‘Oh!’
replied Northcote, ‘if they were Shakspeare’s, they were sure to be
fine. What a power there always is in any <em>bit</em> brought in from him
or Milton among other things! How it shines like a jewel! I
think Milton reads best in this way; he is too fine for a continuance.
Don’t you think Shakspeare and the writers of that day had a
prodigious advantage in using phrases and combinations of style,
which could not be admitted now that the language is reduced to a
more precise and uniform standard, but which yet have a peculiar
force and felicity when they can be justified by the privilege of age?’
He said, he had been struck with this idea lately, in reading an old
translation of Boccacio (about the time of Queen Elizabeth) in
which the language, though quaint, had often a beauty that could not
well be conveyed in any modern translation.</p>

<p class='c013'>He spoke of Lord Byron’s notions about Shakspeare. I said I
did not care much about his opinions. Northcote replied, they were
evidently capricious, and taken up in the spirit of contradiction. I
said, not only so (as far as I can judge), but without any better
founded ones in his own mind. They appear to me conclusions
without premises or any previous process of thought or inquiry. I
like old opinions with new reasons, not new opinions without any—not
mere <em>ipse dixits</em>. He was too arrogant to assign a reason to
others or to need one for himself. It was quite enough that he
subscribed to any assertion, to make it clear to the world, as well
as binding on his valet!</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote said, there were people who could not argue. Fuseli
was one of these. He could throw out very brilliant and striking
things; but if you at all questioned him, he could no more give
an answer than a child of three years old. He had no resources,
nor any <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps de reserve</span></i> of argument beyond his first line of battle.
That was imposing and glittering enough. Neither was Lord
Byron a philosopher, with all his sententiousness and force of
expression. Probably one ought not to expect the two things
together; for to produce a startling and immediate effect, one must
keep pretty much upon the surface; and the search after truth is a
very slow and obscure process.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>
  <h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE ELEVENTH</h4>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As soon as I went in to-day, Northcote asked me if that was <em>my</em>
character of Shakspeare, which had been quoted in a newspaper
the day before? It was so like what he had thought a thousand
times that he could almost swear he had written it himself. I said
no; it was from Kendall’s Letters on Ireland; though I believed
I had expressed nearly the same idea in print. I had seen the
passage myself, and hardly knew at first whether to be pleased or
vexed at it. It was provoking to have one’s words taken out of
one’s mouth as it were by another; and yet it seemed also an
encouragement to reflect, that if one only threw one’s bread upon
the waters, one was sure to find it again after many days. The
world, if they do not listen to an observation the first time, will
listen to it at second-hand from those who have a more agreeable
method of insinuating it, or who do not tell them too many truths
at once. N— said, he thought the account undoubtedly just,
to whomever it belonged.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a> The greatest genius (such as that of
Shakspeare) implied the greatest power, and this implied the greatest
ease and unconsciousness of effort, or of any thing extraordinary
effected. As this writer stated—‘He would as soon think of
being vain of putting one foot before another, as of writing <cite>Macbeth</cite>
or <cite>Hamlet</cite>.’ Or as Hudibras has expressed it, poetry was to him</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—a thing no more difficile</div>
      <div class='line'>Than to a blackbird ’tis to whistle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>‘This (said he) is what I have always said of Correggio’s
style, that he could not help it: it was his nature. Besides, use
familiarizes us to every thing. How could Shakspeare be expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>to be astonished at what he did every day? No; he was thinking
either merely of the subject before him, or of gaining his bread.
It is only upstarts or pretenders, who do not know what to make
of their good fortune or undeserved reputation. It comes to the
same thing that I have heard my brother remark with respect to
my father and old Mr. Tolcher, whose picture you see there. He
had a great friendship for my father and a great opinion of his
integrity; and whenever he came to see him, always began with
saying, “Well, honest Mr. Samuel Northcote, how do you?” This
he repeated so often, and they were so used to it, that my brother
said they became like words of course, and conveyed no more
impression of any thing peculiar than if he had merely said, “Well,
good Mr. Northcote, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et cetera</span></i>,” or used any common expression.
So Shakspeare was accustomed to write his fine speeches till he
ceased to wonder at them himself, and would have been surprised
to find that you did.’</p>

<p class='c013'>The conversation now turned on an answer in a newspaper to
Canning’s assertion, that ‘Slavery was not inconsistent with the
spirit of Christianity, inasmuch as it was the beauty of Christianity
to accommodate itself to all conditions and circumstances.’ Did
Canning mean to say, because Christianity accommodated itself to,
or made the best of all situations, it did not therefore give the
preference to any? Because it recommended mildness and fortitude
under sufferings, did it not therefore condemn the infliction of them?
Or did it not forbid injustice and cruelty in the strongest terms?
This were indeed a daring calumny on its founder: it were an
insolent irony. Don Quixote would not have said so. It was like
the Italian banditti, who when they have cut off the ears of their
victims, make them go down on their knees, and return thanks to
an image of the Virgin Mary for the favour they have done them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>It was because such things do exist, that Christ came to set his face
against them, and to establish the maxim, ‘Do unto others as you
would that they should do unto you.’ If Mr. Canning will say
that the masters would like to be treated as they treat their slaves,
then he may say that slavery is consistent with the spirit of
Christianity. No; the meaning of those maxims of forbearance
and submission, which the Quakers have taken too literally, is, that
you are not to drive out one devil by another; it aims at discouraging
a resort to violence and anger, for if the temper it inculcates could
become universal, there would be no injuries to resent. It objects
against the power of the sword, but it is to substitute a power ten
thousand times stronger than the sword—that which subdues and
conquers the affections, and strikes at the very root and thought
of evil. All that is meant by such sayings, as that if a person
‘smites us on one cheek, we are to turn to him the other,’ is,
that we are to keep as clear as possible of a disposition to retaliate
and exasperate injuries; or there is a Spanish proverb which explains
this, that says, ‘<em>It is he who gives the second blow that begins the
quarrel.</em>’</p>

<p class='c013'>On my referring to what had been sometimes asserted of the
inefficacy of pictures in Protestant churches, Northcote said he
might be allowed to observe in favour of his own art, that though
they might not strike at first from a difference in our own belief,
yet they would gain upon the spectator by the force of habit. The
practice of image-worship was probably an after-thought of the
Papists themselves, from seeing the effects produced on the minds
of the rude and ignorant by visible representations of saints and
martyrs. The rulers of the church at first only thought to amuse
and attract the people by pictures and statues (as they did by music
and rich dresses, from which no inference was to be drawn); but
when these representations of sacred subjects were once placed before
the senses of an uninstructed but imaginative people, they looked at
them with wonder and eagerness, till they began to think they saw
them move; and then miracles were worked; and as this became
a source of wealth and great resort to the several shrines and
churches, every means were used to encourage the superstition and
a belief in the supernatural virtues of the objects by the clergy
and government. So he thought that if pictures were set up in
our churches, they would by degrees inspire the mind with all the
feelings of awe or interest that were necessary or proper. It was
less difficult to excite enthusiasm than to keep it under due restraint.
So in Italy, the higher powers did not much relish those processions
of naked figures, taken from scriptural stories (such as Adam and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>Eve) on particular holidays, for they led to scandal and abuse;
but they fell in with the humour of the rabble, and were lucrative
to the lower orders of priests and friars, and the Pope could not
expressly discountenance them. He said we were in little danger
(either from our religion or temperament) of running into those
disgraceful and fanciful extremes; but should rather do every thing
in our power to avoid the opposite error of a dry and repulsive
asceticism. We <em>could not</em> give too much encouragement to the
fine arts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our talk of to-day concluded by his saying, that he often blamed
himself for uttering what might be thought harsh things; and that
on mentioning this once to Kemble, and saying it sometimes kept
him from sleep after he had been out in company, Kemble had
replied, ‘Oh! you need not trouble yourself so much about them:
others never think of them afterwards!’</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE TWELFTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>Northcote was painting from a little girl when I went in. B—
was there. Something was said of a portrait of Dunning by Sir
Joshua (an unfinished head), and B— observed, ‘Ah! my good
friend, if you and I had known at that time what those things would
fetch, we might have made our fortunes now. By laying out a
few pounds on the loose sketches and sweepings of the lumber-room,
we might have made as many hundreds.’ ‘Yes,’ said Northcote,
‘it was thought they would soon be forgot, and they went for
nothing on that account: but they are more sought after than ever,
because those imperfect hints and studies seem to bring one more
in contact with the artist, and explain the process of his mind in
the several stages. A finished work is, in a manner, detached from
and independent of its author, like a child that can go alone: in the
other case, it seems to be still in progress, and to await his hand
to finish it; or we supply the absence of well-known excellences
out of our own imagination, so that we have a two-fold property
in it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote read something out of a newspaper about the Suffolk-street
Exhibition, in which his own name was mentioned, and
M—’s, the landscape-painter. B— said, his pictures were a
trick—a streak of red, and then a streak of blue. But, said
Northcote, there is some merit in finding out a new trick. I
ventured to hint, that the receipt for his was, clouds upon mountains,
and mountains upon clouds—that there was number and quantity, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>neither form nor colour. He appeared to me an instance of a total
want of imagination; he mistook the character of the feelings
associated with every thing, and I mentioned as an instance his Adam
and Eve, which had been much admired, but which was a panoramic
view of the map of Asia, instead of a representation of our first
parents in Paradise.</p>

<p class='c013'>After B— was gone, we spoke of X—. I regretted his
want of delicacy towards the public as well as towards his private
friends. I did not think he had failed so much from want of capacity,
as from attempting to bully the public into a premature or overstrained
admiration of him, instead of gaining ground upon them by
improving on himself; and he now felt the ill effects of the re-action
of this injudicious proceeding. He had no real love of his art, and
therefore did not apply or give his whole mind sedulously to it;
and was more bent on bespeaking notoriety beforehand by puffs and
announcements of his works, than on giving them that degree of
perfection which would ensure lasting reputation. No one would
ever attain the highest excellence, who had so little nervous sensibility
as to take credit for it (either with himself or others) without being
at the trouble of producing it. It was securing the reward in the
first instance; and afterwards, it would be too much to expect the
necessary exertion or sacrifices. Unlimited credit was as dangerous
to success in art as in business. ‘And yet he still finds dupes,’ said
Northcote; to which I replied, it was impossible to resist him, as
long as you kept on terms with him: any difference of opinion or
reluctance on your part made no impression on him, and unless you
quarrelled with him downright, you must do as he wished you.—‘And
how then,’ said Northcote, ‘do you think it possible for a
person of this hard unyielding disposition to be a painter, where every
thing depends on seizing the nicest inflections of feeling and the most
evanescent shades of beauty?</p>

<p class='c013'>‘No, I’ll tell you why he cannot be a painter. He has not virtue
enough. No one can give out to others what he has not in himself,
and there is nothing in his mind to delight or captivate the world. I
will not deny the mechanical dexterity, but he fails in the mental
part. There was Sir Peter Lely: he is full of defects; but he was
the fine gentleman of his age, and you see this character stamped on
every one of his works;—even his errors prove it; and this is one of
those things that the world receive with gratitude. Sir Joshua again
was not without his faults: he had not grandeur, but he was a man
of a mild, bland, amiable character; and this predominant feeling
appears so strongly in his works, that you cannot mistake it; and this
is what makes them so delightful to look at, and constitutes their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>charm to others, even without their being conscious of it. There
was such a look of nature too. I remember once going through a
suite of rooms where they were shewing me several fine Vandykes;
and we came to one where there were some children, by Sir Joshua,
seen through a door—it was like looking at the reality, they were so
full of life—the branches of the trees waved over their heads, and
the fresh air seemed to play on their cheeks—I soon forgot Vandyke!</p>

<p class='c013'>‘So, in the famous St. Jerome of Correggio, Garrick used to say,
that the Saint resembled a Satyr, and that the child was like a
monkey; but then there is such a look of life in the last, it dazzles
you with spirit and vivacity; you can hardly believe but it will move
or fly;—indeed, Sir Joshua took his Puck from it, only a little varied
in the attitude.’ I said I had seen it not long ago, and that it had
remarkably the look of a spirit or a faery or preternatural being,
though neither beautiful nor dignified. I remarked to Northcote,
that I had never sufficiently relished Correggio; that I had tried
several times to work myself up to the proper degree of admiration,
but that I always fell back again into my former state of lukewarmness
and scepticism; though I could not help allowing, that what he
did, he appeared to me to do with more feeling than any body else;
that I could conceive Raphael or even Titian to have represented
objects from mere natural capacity (as we see them in a looking-glass)
without being absolutely wound up in them, but that I could fancy
Correggio’s pencil to thrill with sensibility: he brooded over the idea
of grace or beauty in his mind till the sense grew faint with it; and
like a lover or a devotee, he carried his enthusiasm to the brink of
extravagance and affectation, so enamoured was he of his art!
Northcote assented to this as a just criticism, and said, ‘That is why
his works must live: but X— is a hardened egotist, devoted to
nothing but himself!’ Northcote then asked about —, and if she
was handsome? I said she might sit for the portrait of Rebecca in
Ivanhoe!</p>

<p class='c013'>He then turned the conversation to Brambletye-House. He
thought the writer had failed in Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> and Rochester. Indeed,
it was a daring attempt to make <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons mots</span></i> for two such characters.
The wit must be sharp and fine indeed, that would do to put into
their mouths: even Sir Walter might tremble to undertake it! He
had made Milton speak too: this was almost as dangerous an attempt
as for Milton to put words into the mouth of the Deity. The great
difficulty was to know where to stop, and not to trespass on forbidden
ground. Cervantes was one of the boldest and most original inventors;
yet he had never ventured beyond his depth. He had in the person
of his hero really represented the maxims of benevolence and generosity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>inculcated by the Christian religion: that was a law to him; and by
his fine conception of the subject, he had miraculously succeeded.
Shakspeare alone could be said in his grotesque creations to be above
all law. Richardson had succeeded admirably in Clarissa, because
he had a certain rule to go by or certain things to avoid, for a perfect
woman was a negative character; but he had failed in Sir Charles
Grandison, and made him a lump of odious affectation, because a
perfect man is not a negative, but a positive character; and in aiming
at faultlessness, he had produced only the most vapid effeminacy.
After all, Brambletye-House was about as good as the <cite>Rejected
Addresses</cite>. There was very little difference between a parody and
an imitation. The defects and peculiarities are equally seized upon
in either case.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not know how Sir Walter would take it. To have
imitators seemed at first a compliment, yet no one liked it. You
could not put Fuseli in a greater passion than by calling Maria Cosway
an imitator of his. Nothing made Sir Joshua so mad, as Miss
Reynolds’s portraits, which were an exact imitation of all his defects.
Indeed, she was obliged to keep them out of his way. He said,
‘They made every body else laugh, and himself cry.’ It is that
which makes every one dread a mimic. Your self-love is alarmed,
without being so easily reassured. You know there is a difference,
but it is not great enough to make you feel quite at ease. The line
of demarcation between the true and the spurious is not sufficiently
broad and palpable. The copy you see is vile or indifferent; and
the original, you suspect (but for your partiality to yourself) is not
perhaps much better.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is what I have often felt in looking at the drawings of the
students at the Academy, or when young artists have brought their
first crude attempts for my opinion. The glaring defects, the abortive
efforts have almost disgusted me with the profession. Good G—d!
I have said, is this what the art is made up of? How do I know
that my own productions may not appear in the same light to others?
Whereas the seeing the finest specimens of art, instead of disheartening,
gives me courage to proceed: one cannot be wrong in treading in the
same footsteps, and to fall short of them is no disgrace, while the
faintest reflection of their excellence is glorious. It was this that
made Correggio cry out on seeing Raphael’s works, ‘I also am a
painter’: he felt a kindred spirit in his own breast.—I said, I recollected
when I was formerly trying to paint, nothing gave me the
horrors so much as passing the old battered portraits at the doors of
brokers’ shops, with the morning-sun flaring full upon them. I was
generally inclined to prolong my walk, and put off painting for that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>day; but the sight of a fine picture had a contrary effect, and I went
back and set to work with redoubled ardour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote happened to speak of a gentleman married to one of the
—, of whom a friend had said, laughing, ‘There’s a man that’s
in love with his own wife!’ He mentioned the beautiful Lady
F— P—, and said her hair, which was in great quantities and
very fine, was remarkable for having a single lock different from all
the rest, which he supposed she cherished as a beauty. I told him I
had not long ago seen the hair of Lucretia Borgia, of Milton,
Buonaparte, and Dr. Johnson, all folded up in the same paper. It
had belonged to Lord Byron. Northcote replied, one could not be
sure of that; it was easy to get a lock of hair, and call it by any
name one pleased. In some cases, however, one might rely on its
being the same. Mrs. G— had certainly a lock of Goldsmith’s
hair, for she and her sister (Miss Horneck) had wished to have
some remembrance of him after his death; and though the coffin was
nailed up, it was opened again at their request (such was the regard
Goldsmith was known to have for them!), and a lock of his hair was
cut off, which Mrs. G— still has. Northcote said, Goldsmith’s
death was the severest blow Sir Joshua ever received—he did not
paint all that day! It was proposed to make a grand funeral for him,
but Reynolds objected to this, as it would be over in a day, and said
it would be better to lay by the money to erect a monument to him
in Westminster Abbey; and he went himself and chose the spot.
Goldsmith had begun another novel, of which he read the first
chapter to the Miss Hornecks a little before his death. Northcote
asked, what I thought of the Vicar of Wakefield? And I answered,
What every body else did. He said there was that mixture of the
ludicrous and the pathetic running through it, which particularly
delighted him: it gave a stronger resemblance to nature. He thought
this justified Shakspeare in mingling up farce and tragedy together:
life itself was a tragi-comedy. Instead of being pure, every thing was
chequered. If you went to an execution, you would perhaps see an
apple-woman in the greatest distress, because her stall was overturned,
at which you could not help smiling. We then spoke of ‘Retaliation,’
and praised the character of Burke in particular as a masterpiece.
Nothing that he had ever said or done but what was foretold in it;
nor was he painted as the principal figure in the foreground with the
partiality of a friend, or as the great man of the day, but with a back-ground
of history, showing both what he was and what he might
have been. Northcote repeated some lines from the ‘Traveller,’
which were distinguished by a beautiful transparency, by simplicity
and originality. He confirmed Boswell’s account of Goldsmith, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>being about the middle height, rather clumsy, and tawdry in his
dress.</p>

<p class='c013'>A gentleman came in who had just shown his good taste in purchasing
three pictures of Northcote, one a head of Sir Joshua by himself,
and the other two by Northcote, a whole-length portrait of an Italian
girl, and a copy of Omai, the South-Sea Chief. I could hear the
artist in the outer room expressing some scruples as to the consistency
of his parting with one of them which he had brought from abroad,
according to the strict letter of his Custom-House oath—an objection
which the purchaser, a Member of Parliament, over-ruled by assuring
him that ‘the peculiar case could not be contemplated by the spirit of
the act.’ Northcote also expressed some regret at the separation
from pictures that had become old friends. He however comforted
himself that they would now find a respectable asylum, which was
better than being knocked about in garrets and auction-rooms, as they
would inevitably be at his death. ‘You may at least depend upon it,’
said Mr. — ‘that they will not be sold again for many generations!’
This view into futurity brought back to my mind the time when I
had first known these pictures: since then, my life was flown, and
with it the hope of fame as an artist (with which I had once regarded
them), and I felt a momentary pang. Northcote took me out into
the other room, when his friend was gone, to look at them; and on
my expressing my admiration of the portrait of the Italian lady, he
said she was the mother of Madame Bellochi, and was still living;
that he had painted it at Rome about the year 1780; that her family
was originally Greek, and that he had known her, her daughter, her
mother, and grandmother. She and a sister who was with her, were
at that time full of the most charming gaiety and innocence. The
old woman used to sit upon the ground without moving or speaking,
with her arm over her head, and exactly like a bundle of old clothes.
Alas! thought I, what are we but a heap of clay resting upon the
earth, and ready to crumble again into dust and ashes!</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE THIRTEENTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>Northcote spoke about the failure of some print-sellers. He said,
‘He did not wonder at it; it was a just punishment of their presumption
and ignorance. They went into an Exhibition, looked
round them, fixed upon some contemptible performance, and without
knowing any thing about the matter or consulting any body, ordered
two or three thousand pounds’ worth of prints from it, merely out of
purse-proud insolence, and because the money <em>burnt in their pockets</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>Such people fancied that the more money they laid out, the more
they must get; so that extravagance became (by the turn their vanity
gave to it) another name for thrift.’ Having spoken of a living
artist’s pictures as mere portraits that were interesting to no one
except the people who sat for them, he remarked,  ‘There was
always something in the meanest face that a great artist could take
advantage of. That was the merit of Sir Joshua, who contrived to
throw a certain air and character even over ugliness and folly, that
disarmed criticism and made you wonder how he did it. This, at
least, is the case with his portraits; for though he made his beggars
look like heroes, he sometimes, in attempting history, made his heroes
look like beggars. Grandi, the Italian colour-grinder, sat to him for
King Henry <span class='fss'>VI.</span> in the <cite>Death of Cardinal Beaufort</cite>, and he looks not
much better than a train-bearer or one in a low and mean station: if
he had sat to him for his portrait, he would have made him look like
a king! That was what made Fuseli observe in joke that “Grandi
never held up his head after Sir Joshua painted him in his Cardinal
Beaufort!” But the pictures I speak of are poor dry <em>fac-similes</em> (in a
little timid manner and with an attempt at drapery) of imbecile
creatures, whose appearance is a satire on themselves and mankind.
Neither can I conceive why L— should be sent over to paint
Charles <span class='fss'>X.</span> A French artist said to me on that occasion, ‘We have
very fine portrait-painters in Paris, Sir!’... The poor engraver
would be the greatest sufferer by these expensive prints. Tradespeople
now-a-days did not look at the thing with an eye to business,
but ruined themselves and others by setting up for <em>would-be</em> patrons
and judges of the art.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Some demon whisper’d, Visto, have a taste!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>I said I thought L—’s pictures might do very well as mirrors for
personal vanity to contemplate itself in (as you looked in the glass to
see how you were dressed), but that it was a mistake to suppose they
would interest any one else or were addressed to the world at large.
They were private, not public property. They never caught the eye
in a shop window; but were (as it appeared to me) a kind of
<em>lithographic</em> painting, or thin, meagre outlines without the depth and
richness of the art. I mentioned to Northcote the pleasure I had
formerly taken in a little print of <cite>Gadshill</cite> from a sketch of his own,
which I used at one time to pass a certain shop-window on purpose to
look at. He said, ‘It was impossible to tell beforehand what would
hit the public. You might as well pretend to say what ticket would
turn up a prize in the lottery. It was not chance neither, but some
unforeseen coincidence between the subject and the prevailing taste,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>that you could not possibly be a judge of. I had once painted two
pictures; one of a Fortune-teller (a boy with a monkey), and another
called ‘The Visit to the Grandmother;’ and Raphael Smith came
to me and wanted to engrave them, being willing to give a handsome
sum for the first, but only to do the last as an experiment. He sold
ten times as many of the last as of the first, and told me that there
were not less than five different impressions done of it in Paris; and
once when I went to his house to get one to complete a set of
engravings after my designs, they asked me six guineas for a proof-impression!
This was too much, but I was delighted that I could
not afford to pay for my own work, from the value that was set upon
it!’—I said, people were much alarmed at the late failures, and
thought there would be a ‘blow-up,’ in the vulgar phrase.—‘Surely
you can’t suppose so? A blow-up! Yes, of adventurers and
upstarts, but not of the country, if they mean that. This is like the
man who thought that gin-drinking would put an end to the world.
Oh! no—the country will go on just as before, bating the distress to
individuals. You may form an idea on the subject if you ever go to
look at the effects of a fire the day after: you see nothing but smoke
and ruins and bare walls, and think the damage can never be repaired;
but if you pass by the same way a week after, you will find the houses
all built up just as they were before or even better than ever! No,
there is the same wealth, the same industry and ingenuity in the
country as there was before; and till you destroy that, you cannot
destroy the country. These temporary distresses are only like
disorders in the body, that carry off its bad and superfluous humours.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘My neighbour Mr. Rowe, the bookseller, informed me the other
day that Signora Cecilia Davies frequently came to his shop, and
always inquired after me. Did you ever hear of her?’ No never!
‘She must be very old now. Fifty years ago, in the time of Garrick,
she made a vast sensation. All England rang with her name. I do
assure you, that in this respect Madame Catalani was not more talked
of. Afterwards she had retired to Florence, and was the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Prima
Donna</span></i> there, when Storace first came out. This was at the time
when Mr. Hoare and myself were in Italy; and I remember we
went to call upon her. She had then in a great measure fallen off,
but she was still very much admired. What a strange thing a reputation
of this kind is, that the person herself survives, and sees the
meteors of fashion rise and fall one after another, while she remains
totally disregarded as if there had been no such person, yet thinking
all the while that she was better than any of them! I have hardly
heard her name mentioned in the last thirty years, though in her
time she was quite as famous as any one since.’ I said, an <em>Opera</em>-reputation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>was after all but a kind of <em>Private Theatricals</em> and confined
to a small circle, compared with that of the regular stage, which all
the world were judges of and took an interest in. It was but the
echo of a sound, or like the blaze of phosphorus that did not
communicate to the surrounding objects. It belonged to a fashionable
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coterie</span></i>, rather than to the public, and might easily die away at the end
of the season. I then observed I was more affected by the fate of
players than by that of any other class of people. They seemed to
me more to be pitied than any body—the contrast was so great
between the glare, the noise, and intoxication of their first success,
and the mortifications and neglect of their declining years. They
were made drunk with popular applause; and when this stimulus was
withdrawn, must feel the insignificance of ordinary life particularly
vapid and distressing. There were no sots like the <em>sots of vanity</em>.
There were no traces left of what they had been, any more than of a
forgotten dream; and they had no consolation but in their own
conceit, which, when it was without other vouchers, was a very
uneasy comforter. I had seen some actors who had been favourites
in my youth and ‘cried up in the top of the compass,’ treated, from
having grown old and infirm, with the utmost indignity and almost
hooted from the stage. I had seen poor — come forward under
these circumstances to stammer out an apology with the tears in his eyes
(which almost brought them into mine) to a set of apprentice-boys
and box-lobby loungers, who neither knew nor cared what a fine
performer and a fine gentleman he was thought twenty years ago.
Players were so far particularly unfortunate. The theatrical public
have a very short memory. Every four or five years there is a new
audience, who know nothing but of what they have before their eyes,
and who pronounce summarily upon this, without any regard to past
obligations or past services, and with whom the veterans of the stage
stand a bad chance indeed, as their former triumphs are entirely
forgotten, while they appear as living vouchers against themselves.
‘Do you remember,’ said Northcote, ‘Sheridan’s beautiful lines on
the subject in his <cite>Monody on Garrick</cite>?’ I said, I did; and that it
was probably the reading them early that had impressed this feeling
so strongly on my mind. Northcote then remarked, ‘I think a great
beauty is most to be pitied. She completely outlives herself. She
has been used to the most bewitching homage, to have the highest
court paid and the most flattering things said to her by all those who
approach her, and to be received with looks of delight and surprise
wherever she comes; and she afterwards not only finds herself
deprived of all this and reduced to a cypher, but sees it all transferred
to another, who has become the reigning toast and beauty of the day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>in her stead. It must be a most violent shock. It is like a king
who is dethroned and reduced to serve as a page in his own palace.
I remember once being struck with seeing the Duchess of
—, the same that Sir Joshua painted, and who was a miracle of
beauty when she was young, and followed by crowds wherever she
went—I was coming out of Mrs. W—’s; and on the landing-place,
there was she standing by herself, and calling over the bannister for
her servant to come to her. If she had been as she once was, a
thousand admirers would have flown to her assistance; but her face
was painted over like a mask, and there was hardly any appearance
of life left but the restless motion of her eyes. I was really hurt.’
I answered, the late Queen had much the same painful look that he
described—her face highly <em>rouged</em>, and her eyes rolling in her head
like an automaton, but she had not the mortification of having ever
been a great beauty. ‘There was a Miss —, too,’ Northcote
added, ‘who was a celebrated beauty when she was a girl, and who
also sat to Sir Joshua. I saw her not long ago and she was grown
as coarse and vulgar as possible; she was like an apple-woman or
would do to keep the <em>Three Tuns</em>. The change must be very mortifying.
To be sure, there is one thing, it comes on by degrees.
The ravages of the small-pox must formerly have been a dreadful
blow!’ He said, literary men or men of talent in general were the
best off in this respect. The reputation they acquired was not only
lasting, but gradually grew stronger, if it was deserved. I agreed
they were seldom spoiled by flattery, and had no reason to complain
<em>after they were dead</em>. ‘Nor while they are living,’ said N—, ‘if
it is not their own fault.’ He mentioned an instance of a trial about
an engraving where he, West, and others had to appear, and of the
respect that was shown them. Erskine after flourishing away, made
an attempt to puzzle Stothard by drawing two angles on a piece of
paper, an acute and an obtuse one, and asking, ‘Do you mean to say
these two are alike?’ ‘Yes, I do,’ was the answer. ‘I see,’ said
Erskine, turning round, ‘there is nothing to be got by <em>angling</em> here!’
West was then called upon to give his evidence, and there was immediately
a lane made for him to come forward, and a stillness that you
could hear a pin drop. The Judge (Lord Kenyon) then addressed
him, ‘Sir Benjamin, we shall be glad to hear your opinion!’ Mr.
West answered, ‘He had never received the honour of a title from
his Majesty;’ and proceeded to explain the difference between the
two engravings which were charged with being copies the one of the
other, with such clearness and knowledge of the art, though in
general he was a bad speaker, that Lord Kenyon said when he had
done, ‘I suppose, gentlemen, you are perfectly satisfied—I perceive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>there is much more in this than I had any idea of, and am sorry I
did not make it more my study when I was young!’ I remarked
that I believed corporations of art or letters might meet with a certain
attention; but it was the stragglers and candidates that were knocked
about with very little ceremony. Talent or merit only wanted a frame
of some sort or other to set it off to advantage. Those of my way of
thinking were ‘bitter bad judges’ on this point. A Tory scribe who
treated mankind as rabble and <em>canaille</em>, was regarded by them in return
as a fine gentleman: a reformer like myself, who stood up for liberty
and equality, was taken at his word by the very journeymen that set
up his paragraphs, and could not get a civil answer from the meanest
shop-boy in the employ of those on his own side of the question.
N— laughed and said, I irritated myself too much about such things.
He said it was one of Sir Joshua’s maxims that the art of life consisted
in not being overset by trifles. We should look at the bottom
of the account, not at each individual item in it, and see how the
balance stands at the end of the year. We should be satisfied if the
path of life is clear before us, and not fret at the straws or pebbles
that lie in our way. What you have to look to is whether you can
get what you write printed, and whether the public will read it, and
not to busy yourself with the remarks of shop-boys or printers’ devils.
They can do you neither harm nor good. The impertinence of
mankind is a thing that no one can guard against.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE FOURTEENTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>Northcote shewed me a poem with engravings of Dartmoor, which
were too fine by half. I said I supposed Dartmoor would look more
gay and smiling after having been thus illustrated, like a dull author
who has been praised by a Reviewer. I had once been nearly
benighted there and was delighted to get to the inn at Ashburton.
‘That,’ said N—, ‘is the only good of such places that you are glad
to escape from them, and look back to them with a pleasing horror
ever after. Commend me to the Valdarno or Vallambrosa, where you
are never weary of new charms, and which you quit with a sigh of regret.
I have, however, told my young friend who sent me the poem, that he
has shown his genius in creating beauties where there were none, and
extracting enthusiasm from rocks and quagmires. After that, he
may write a very interesting poem on Kamschatka!’ He then
spoke of the Panorama of the North Pole which had been lately
exhibited, of the ice-bergs, the seals lying asleep on the shore, and
the strange twilight as well worth seeing. He said, it would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>curious to know the effect, if they could get to the Pole itself, though
it must be impossible: the veins, he should suppose, would burst, and
the vessel itself go to pieces from the extreme cold. I asked if he
had ever read an account of twelve men who had been left all the
winter in Greenland, and of the dreadful shifts to which they were
reduced? He said, he had not.—They were obliged to build two
booths of wood one within the other; and if they had to go into the
outer one during the severity of the weather, unless they used great
precaution, their hands were blistered by whatever they took hold of
as if it had been red-hot iron. The most interesting part was the
account of their waiting for the return of light at the approach of
spring, and the delight with which they first saw the sun shining on
the tops of the frozen mountains. N— said, ‘This is the great
advantage of descriptions of extraordinary situations by uninformed
men: Nature as it were holds the pen for them; they give you what
is most striking in the circumstances, and there is nothing to draw
off the attention from the strong and actual impression, so that it is
the next thing to the reality. G— was here the other day, and I
showed him the note from my bookseller about the <cite>Fables</cite>, with
which you were so much pleased, but he saw nothing in it. I then
said G— is not one of those who look attentively at nature or draw
much from that source. Yet the rest is but like building castles in
the air, if it is not founded in observation and experience. Or it is
like the enchanted money in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, which turned to
dry leaves when you came to make use of it. It is ingenious and
amusing, and so far it is well to be amused when you can; but you
learn nothing from the fine hypothesis you have been reading, which
is only a better sort of dream, bright and vague and utterly inapplicable
to the purposes of common life. G— does not appeal to nature,
but to art and execution. There is another thing (which it seems
harsh and presumptuous to say, but) he appears to me not always to
perceive the difference between right and wrong. There are many
others in the same predicament, though not such splendid examples
of it. He is satisfied to make out a plausible case, to give the <em>pros</em>
and <em>cons</em> like a lawyer; but he has no instinctive bias or feeling one
way or other, except as he can give a studied reason for it. Common
sense is out of the question: such people despise common sense, and
the quarrel between them is a mutual one. Caleb Williams, notwithstanding,
is a decidedly original work: the rest are the sweepings
of his study. That is but one thing, to be sure; but no one does
more than one thing. Northcote said that Sir Joshua used to say
that no one produced more than six original things. I always said
it was wrong to fix upon this number—five out of the six would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>found upon examination to be repetitions of the first. A man can
no more produce six original works than he can be six individuals at
once. Whatever is the strong and prevailing bent of his genius, he
will stamp upon some master-work; and what he does else, will be
only the same thing over again, a little better or a little worse; or if
he goes out of his way in search of variety and to avoid himself, he
will merely become a common-place man or an imitator of others. You
see this plainly enough in Cervantes—that he has exhausted himself in
the Don Quixote. He has put his whole strength into it: his other
works are no better than what other people could write. If there is
any exception, it is Shakspeare: he seems to have had the faculty of
dividing himself into a number of persons. His writings stand out
from every thing else, and from one another. Othello, Lear,
Macbeth, Falstaff are striking and original characters; but they die
a natural death at the end of the fifth act, and no more come to life
again than the people themselves would. He is not reduced to
repeat himself or revive former inventions under feigned names.
This is peculiar to him; still it is to be considered that plays are
short works and only allow room for the expression of a part. But
in a work of the extent of Don Quixote, the writer had scope to
bring in all he wanted; and indeed there is no point of excellence
which he has not touched from the highest courtly grace and most
romantic enthusiasm down to the lowest ribaldry and rustic ignorance,
yet carried off with such an air that you wish nothing away, and do
not see what can be added to it. Every bit is perfect; and the
author has evidently given his whole mind to it. That is why I
believe that the <cite>Scotch Novels</cite> are the production of several hands.
Some parts are careless, others straggling: it is only where there is
an opening for effect that the master-hand comes in, and in general
he leaves his work for others to get on with it. But in Don
Quixote there is not a single line that you may not swear belongs to
Cervantes.’—I inquired if he had read <span class='sc'>Woodstock</span>? He answered,
No, he had not been able to get it. I said, I had been obliged to
pay five shillings for the loan of it at a regular bookseller’s shop (I
could not procure it at the circulating libraries), and that from the
understood feeling about Sir Walter no objection was made to this
proposal, which would in ordinary cases have been construed into an
affront. I had well nigh repented my bargain, but there were one
or two scenes that repaid me (though none equal to his best,) and
in general it was very indifferent. The plot turned chiefly on English
Ghost-scenes, a very mechanical sort of phantoms who dealt in practical
jokes and personal annoyances, turning beds upside down and sousing
you all over with water, instead of supernatural and visionary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>horrors. It was very bad indeed, but might be intended to contrast
the literal, matter-of-fact imagination of the <em>Southron</em> with the loftier
impulses of Highland superstition. Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> was not spared, and
was brought in admirably (when in disguise) as a raw, awkward
Scotch lad, Master Kerneguy. Cromwell was made a fine, bluff,
overbearing blackguard, who exercised a personal superiority wherever
he came, but was put in situations which I thought wholly out of
character, and for which I apprehended there was no warrant in the
history of the times. They were therefore so far improper. A
romance-writer might take an incident and work it out according to
his fancy or might build an imaginary superstructure on the ground of
history, but he had no right to transpose the facts. For instance, he
had made Cromwell act as his own tip-staff and go to Woodstock to
take Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> in person. To be sure, he had made him display
considerable firmness and courage in the execution of this errand (as
Lavender might in being the first to enter a window to secure a
desperate robber)—but the plan itself, to say nothing of the immediate
danger, was contrary to Cromwell’s dignity as well as policy. Instead
of wishing to seize Charles with his own hand, he would naturally
keep as far aloof from such a scene as he could, and be desirous to
have it understood that he was anxious to shed as little more blood as
possible. Besides, he had higher objects in view, and would, I should
think, care not much more about Charles than about Master Kerneguy.
He would be glad to let him get away. In another place, he had
made Cromwell start back in the utmost terror at seeing a picture of
Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> and act all the phrenzy of Macbeth over again at the sight
of Banquo’s ghost. This I should also suppose to be quite out of
character in a person of Cromwell’s prosaic, determined habits <em>to fear
a painted devil</em>. ‘No,’ said N—, ‘that is not the way he would
look at it; it is seeing only a part: but Cromwell was a greater
philosopher than to act so. The other story is more probable of his
visiting the dead body of Charles in a mask, and exclaiming in great
agitation as he left the room, <em>Cruel necessity</em>! Yet even this is not
sufficiently authenticated. No; he knew that it was come to this,
that it was gone too far for either party to turn back, and that it must
be final with one of them. The only question was whether he should
give himself up as the victim, and so render all that had been done
useless, or exact the penalty from what he thought the offending
party. It was like a battle which must end fatally either way, and
no one thought of lamenting, because he was not on the losing side.
In a great public quarrel there was no room for these domestic and
personal regards: all you had to do was to consider well the justice
of the cause, before you appealed to the sword. Would Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>he had been victorious, have started at the sight of a picture of
Cromwell? Yet Cromwell was as much of a man as he, and as firm
as the other was obstinate.’ Northcote said, he wished he could
remember the subject of a dispute he had with G— to see if I did
not think he had the best of it. I replied, I should be more curious
to hear something in which G— was right, for he generally made
it a rule to be in the wrong when speaking of any thing. I mentioned
having once had a very smart debate with him about a young lady, of
whom I had been speaking as very much like her aunt, a celebrated
authoress, and as what the latter, I conceived, might have been at her
time of life. G— said, when Miss — did any thing like
Evelina or Cecilia, he should then believe she was as clever as
Madame d’Arblay. I asked him whether he did not think Miss
Burney was as clever before she wrote those novels as she was after;
or whether in general an author wrote a successful work for being
clever, or was clever because he had written a successful work!
Northcote laughed and said, ‘That was so like G—.’ I observed
that it arose out of his bigoted admiration of literature, so that he
could see no merit in any thing else; nor trust to any evidence of
talent but what was printed. It was much the same fallacy that had
sometimes struck me in the divines, who deduced original sin from
Adam’s eating the apple, and not his eating the apple from original
sin or a previous inclination to do something, that he should not.
Northcote remarked, that speaking of Evelina put him in mind of
what Opie had once told him, that when Dr. Johnson sat to him for
his picture, on his first coming to town, he asked him if it was true
that he had sat up all night to read Miss Burney’s new novel, as it
had been reported? And he made answer, ‘I never read it through
at all, though I don’t wish this to be known.’ Sir Joshua also pretended
to have read it through at a sitting, though it appeared to him
(Northcote) affectation in them both, who were thorough-paced men
of the world, and hackneyed in literature, to pretend to be so delighted
with the performance of a girl, in which they could find neither
instruction nor any great amusement, except from the partiality of
friendship. So Johnson cried up Savage, because they had slept on
bulks when they were young; and lest he should be degraded into
a vagabond by the association, had elevated the other into a genius.
Such prevarication or tampering with his own convictions was not
consistent with the strict and formal tone of morality which he
assumed on other and sometimes very trifling occasions, such as correcting
Mrs. Thrale for saying that a bird flew in at the door, instead
of the window. I said, Savage, in my mind, was one of those writers
(like Chatterton) whose vices and misfortunes the world made a <em>set-off</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>to their genius, because glad to connect these ideas together. They
were only severe upon those who attacked their prejudices or their
consequence. Northcote replied, ‘Savage the architect was here the
other day, and asked me why I had abused his name-sake, and called
him an impostor. I answered, I had heard that character of him
from a person in an obscure rank of life, who had known him a little
before his death.’ Northcote proceeded: ‘People in that class are
better judges than poets and moralists, who explain away every thing
by fine words and doubtful theories. The mob are generally right
in their summary judgments upon offenders. A man is seldom ducked
or pumped upon or roughly handled by them, unless he has deserved
it. You see that in the galleries at the play-house. They never let
any thing pass that is immoral; and they are even fastidious judges of
wit. I remember there was some gross expression in Goldsmith’s
comedy the first night it came out; and there was a great uproar in
the gallery, and it was obliged to be suppressed. Though rude and
vulgar themselves, they do not like vulgarity on the stage; they come
there to be taught manners.’ I said, they paid more attention than
any body else; and after the curtain drew up (though somewhat
noisy before) were the best-behaved part of the audience, unless something
went wrong. As the common people sought for refinement as
a <em>treat</em>, people in high life were fond of grossness and ribaldry as a
relief to their overstrained affectation of gentility. I could account
in no other way for their being amused with the wretched <em>slang</em> in
certain magazines and newspapers. I asked Northcote if he had
seen the third series of —? He had not. I said they were like
the composition of a footman, and I believed greatly admired in the
upper circles, who were glad to see an author arrange a side-board
for them over again with servile alacrity. He said, ‘They delight in
low, coarse buffoonery, because it sets off their own superiority:
whereas the rabble resent it when obtruded upon them, because they
think it is meant against themselves. They require the utmost
elegance and propriety for their money: as the showman says in
Goldsmith’s comedy—“My bear dances to none but the genteelest
of tunes, <cite>Water parted from the Sea</cite>, or the minuet in <cite>Ariadne</cite>!”’</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote then alluded to a new novel he had been reading. He
said he never read a book so full of words; which seemed ridiculous
enough to say, for a book was necessarily composed of words, but
here there was nothing else but words, to a degree that was surprising.
Yet he believed it was sought after, and indeed he could not
get it at the common library. ‘You are to consider, there must be
books for all tastes and all ages. You may despise it, but the world
do not. There are books for children till the time they are six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>years of age, such as Jack-the-Giant-Killer, the Seven Champions of
Christendom, Guy of Warwick and others.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a> From that to twelve
they like to read the Pilgrim’s Progress and Robinson Crusoe, and
then Fielding’s Novels and Don Quixote: from twenty to thirty
books of poetry, Milton, Pope, Shakspeare: and from thirty history
and philosophy—what suits us then will serve us for the rest of our
lives. For boarding-school girls <cite>Thomson’s Seasons</cite> has an immense
attraction, though I never could read it. Some people cannot get
beyond a newspaper or a geographical dictionary. What I mean to
infer is that we ought not to condemn too hastily, for a work may be
approved by the public, though it does not exactly hit our taste; nay,
those may seem beauties to others which seem faults to us. Why
else do we pride ourselves on the superiority of our judgment, if we
are not more advanced in this respect than the majority of readers?
But our very fastidiousness should teach us toleration. You have
said very well of this novel, that it is a mixture of genteel and
romantic affectation. One objection to the excessive rhodomontade
which abounds in it is that you can learn nothing from such extravagant
fictions:—they are like nothing in the known world. I
remember once speaking to Richardson (Sheridan’s friend) about
Shakspeare’s want of morality, and he replied—“What! Shakspeare
not moral? He is the most moral of all writers, because he is the
most natural!” And in this he was right: for though Shakspeare
did not intend to be moral, yet he could not be otherwise as long as
he adhered to the path of nature. Morality only teaches us our duty
by showing us the natural consequences of our actions; and the poet
does the same while he continues to give us faithful and affecting
pictures of human life—rewarding the good and punishing the bad.
So far truth and virtue are one. But that kind of poetry which has
not its foundation in nature, and is only calculated to shock and
surprise, tends to unhinge our notions of morality and of every thing
else in the ordinary course of Providence.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Something being said of an artist who had attempted to revive the
great style in our times, and the question being put, whether Michael
Angelo and Raphael, had they lived now, would not have accommodated
themselves to the modern practice, I said, it appeared to me
that (whether this was the case or not) they could not have done
what they did without the aid of circumstances; that for an artist to
raise himself above all surrounding opinions, customs, and institutions
by a mere effort of the will, was affectation and folly, like attempting
to fly in the air; and that, though great genius might exist without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>the opportunities favourable to its development, yet it must draw its
nourishment from circumstances, and suck in inspiration from its
native air. There was Hogarth—he was surely a genius; still the
manners of his age were necessary to him: teeming as his works were
with life, character, and spirit, they would have been poor and vapid
without the night-cellars of St. Giles’s, the drawing-rooms of St.
James’s! Would he in any circumstances have been a Raphael or
a Phidias? I think not. But had he been twenty times a Raphael
or a Phidias, I am quite sure it would never have appeared in
the circumstances in which he was placed. Two things are
necessary to all great works and great excellence, the mind of
the individual and the mind of the age or country co-operating
with his own genius. The last brings out the first, but the first
does not imply or supersede the last. Pictures for Protestant
churches are a contradiction in terms, where they are not objects of
worship but of idle curiosity:—where there is not the adoration, the
enthusiasm in the spectator, how can it exist in the artist? The
spark of genius is only kindled into a flame by sympathy.—Northcote
spoke highly of Vanbrugh and of the calm superiority with which he
bore the attacks of Swift, Pope, and that set who made a point of
decrying all who did not belong to their party. He said Burke and
Sir Joshua thought his architecture far from contemptible; and his
comedies were certainly first-rate. Richards (the scene-painter) had
told him, the players thought the Provoked Husband the best acting
play on the stage; and Godwin said the City-Wives’ Confederacy
(taken from an indifferent French play) was the best written one.
I ventured to add, that the Trip to Scarborough (altered but not
improved by Sheridan) was not inferior to either of the others. I
should doubt whether the direction given at Sir Tunbelly’s castle on
the arrival of Young Fashion—‘Let loose the grey-hound, and lock
up Miss Hoyden!’—would be in Sheridan’s version, who, like most
of his countrymen, had a prodigious ambition of elegance. Northcote
observed, that talking of this put him in mind of a droll speech that
was made when the officers got up a play on board the vessel that
went lately to find out the North-West passage:—one of the sailors,
who was admiring the performance, and saying how clever it was,
was interrupted by the boatswain, who exclaimed—‘Clever! did
you say? I call it <em>philosophy</em>, by G—d!’ He asked, if he had ever
mentioned to me that anecdote of Lord Mansfield, who, when an
old woman was brought before him as a witch, and was charged,
among other improbable things, with walking through the air, attended
coolly to the evidence, and then dismissed the complaint by saying,
‘My opinion is that this good woman be suffered to return home, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>whether she shall do this, walking on the ground or riding through
the air, must be left entirely to her own pleasure, for there is nothing
contrary to the laws of England in either!’ I mentioned a very fine
dancer at the Opera (Mademoiselle Brocard) with whom I was much
delighted; and Northcote observed that where there was grace and
beauty accompanying the bodily movements, it was very hard to deny
the mental refinement or the merit of this art. He could not see
why that which was so difficult to do, and which gave so much
pleasure to others, was to be despised. He remembered seeing some
young people at Parma (though merely in a country-dance) exhibit a
degree of perfection in their movements that seemed to be inspired by
the very genius of grace and gaiety. Miss Reynolds used to say
that perfection was much the same in everything—nobody could
assign the limits. I said authors alone were privileged to suppose
that all excellence was confined to words. Till I was twenty I
thought there was nothing in the world but books: when I began to
paint I found there were two things, both difficult to do and worth
doing; and I concluded from that time there might be fifty. At
least I was willing to allow every one his own choice. I recollect a
certain poet saying ‘he should like to <em>ham-string</em> those fellows at the
Opera’—I suppose because the Great would rather see them dance
than read <cite>Kehama</cite>. Whatever can be done in such a manner that
you can fancy a God to do it, must have something in its nature
divine. The ancients had assigned Gods to dancing as well as to
music and poetry, to the different attributes and perfections both of
body and mind; and perhaps the plurality of the heathen deities was
favourable to a liberality of taste and opinion. <span class='sc'>Northcote</span>: ‘The
most wretched scribbler looks down upon the greatest painter as a
mere mechanic: but who would compare Lord Byron with Titian?’</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE FIFTEENTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>I went to Northcote in the evening to consult about his <cite>Fables</cite>. He
was downstairs in the parlour, and talked much as usual: but the
difference of the accompaniments, the sitting down, the preparations
for tea, the carpet and furniture, and a little fat lap-dog interfered
with old associations and took something from the charm of his
conversation. He spoke of a Mr. Laird who had been employed to
see his <cite>Life of Sir Joshua</cite> through the press, and whom he went to
call upon in an upper story in Peterborough-Court, Fleet-street, where
he was surrounded by his books, his implements of writing, a hand-organ,
and his coffee-pots; and he said he envied him this retreat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>more than any palace he had ever happened to enter. Northcote was
not very well, and repeated his complaints. I said I thought the air
(now summer was coming on) would do him more good than physic.
His apothecary had been describing the dissection of the elephant,
which had just been killed at Exeter ‘Change. It appeared that
instead of the oil which usually is found in the joints of animals, the
interstices were in this case filled up with a substance resembling a
kind of white paint. This Northcote considered as a curious instance
of the wise contrivance of nature in the adaptation of means to ends;
for even in pieces of artificial mechanism, though they use oil to
lubricate the springs and wheels of clocks and other common-sized
instruments, yet in very large and heavy ones, such as steam-engines,
&amp;c. they are obliged to use grease, pitch, and other more solid
substances, to prevent the friction. If they could dissect a flea, what
a fine, evanescent fluid would be found to lubricate its slender joints
and assist its light movements! Northcote said the bookseller wished
to keep the original copy of the <cite>Fables</cite> to bind up as a literary
curiosity. I objected to this proceeding as unfair. There were
several slips of the pen and slovenlinesses of style (for which I did
not think him at all accountable, since an artist wrote with his left
hand, and painted with his right) and I did not see why these
accidental inadvertences, arising from diffidence and want of practice,
should be as it were enshrined and brought against him. He said,
‘Mr. P— H— tasked me the hardest in what I wrote in the
<cite>Artist</cite>. He pointed out where I was wrong, and sent it back to me
to correct it. After all, what I did there was thought the best!’
I said Mr. H— was too fastidious, and spoiled what he did from
a wish to have it perfect. He dreaded that a shadow of objection
should be brought against any thing he advanced, so that his opinions
at last amounted to a kind of genteel truisms. One must risk something
in order to do any thing. I observed that this was remarkable
in so clever a man; but it seemed as if there were some fatality by
which the most lively and whimsical writers, if they went out of their
own eccentric path and attempted to be serious, became exceedingly
grave and even insipid. His farces were certainly very spirited and
original: <span class='sc'>No Song no Supper</span> was the first play I had ever seen,
and I felt grateful to him for this. Northcote agreed that it was
very delightful; and said there was a volume of it when he first read
it to them one night at Mrs. Rundle’s, and that the players cut it
down a good deal and supplied a number of things. There was a
great piece of work to alter the songs for Madame Storace, who
played in it and who could not pronounce half the English terminations.
<span class='sc'>My Grandmother</span>, too, was a laughable idea, very ingeniously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>executed; and some of the songs in this had an equal portion of elegance
and drollery, such as that in particular—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For alas! long before I was born,</div>
      <div class='line'>My fair one had died of old age!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Still some of his warmest admirers were hurt at their being farces—if
they had been comedies, they would have been satisfied, for
nothing could be greater than their success. They were the next to
O’Keefe’s, who in that line was the English Moliere.</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote asked if I remembered the bringing out of any of
O’Keefe’s? I answered, No. He said ‘It had the oddest effect
imaginable—at one moment they seemed on the point of being
damned, and the next moment you were convulsed with laughter.
Edwin was inimitable in some of them. He was one of those actors,
it is true, who carried a great deal off the stage with him, that he
would willingly have left behind, and so far could not help himself.
But his awkward, shambling figure in Bowkitt the dancing-master,
was enough to make one die with laughing. He was also unrivalled
in <cite>Lingo</cite>, where he was admirably supported by Mrs. Wells in
Cowslip, when she prefers “a roast duck” to all the birds in the
Heathen Mythology—and in <cite>Peeping Tom</cite>, where he merely puts his
head out, the faces that he made threw the audience into a roar.’ I
said, I remembered no further back than B—, who used to delight
me excessively in <cite>Lenitive</cite> in the Prize, when I was a boy. Northcote
said, he was an imitator of Edwin, but at a considerable distance.
He was a good-natured, agreeable man; and the audience were
delighted with him, because he was evidently delighted with them.
In some respects he was a caricaturist: for instance, in Lenitive he
stuck his pigtail on end, which he had no right to do, for no one had
ever done it but himself. I said Liston appeared to me to have more
comic humour than any one in my time, though he was not properly
an actor. Northcote asked if he was not low-spirited; and told the
story (I suspect an old one) of his consulting a physician on the state
of his health, who recommended him to go and see Liston. I said
he was grave and prosing, but I did not know there was any thing
the matter with him, though I had seen him walking along the street
the other day with his face as fixed as if had a lock-jaw, a book in
his hand, looking neither to the right nor the left, and very much like
his own Lord Duberly. I did not see why he and Matthews should
both of them be so <em>hipped</em>, except from their having <em>the player’s melancholy</em>,
arising from their not seeing six hundred faces on the broad
grin before them at all other times as well as when they were acting.
He was, however, exceedingly unaffected, and remarkably candid in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>judging of other actors. He always spoke in the highest terms of
Munden, whom I considered as overdoing his parts.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a> Northcote
said, ‘Munden was excellent but an artificial actor. You should
have seen Weston,’ he continued. ‘It was impossible, from looking
at him, for any one to say that he was acting. You would
suppose they had gone out and found the actual character they
wanted, and brought him upon the stage without his knowing it.
Even when they interrupted him with peals of laughter and applause,
he looked about him as if he was not at all conscious of having any
thing to do with it, and then went on as before. In Scrub, Dr. Last,
and other parts of that kind, he was perfection itself. Garrick would
never attempt Abel Drugger after him. There was something
peculiar in his face; for I knew an old school-fellow of his who told
me he used to produce the same effect when a boy, and when the
master asked what was the matter, his companions would make
answer—‘Weston looked <em>at me</em>, Sir!’ Yet he came out in
tragedy, as indeed they all did! Northcote inquired if I had
seen Garrick? I answered, ‘No—I could not very well, as he
died the same year I was born!’ I mentioned having lately
met with a striking instance of genealogical taste in a family, the
grandfather of which thought nothing of Garrick, the father thought
nothing of Mrs. Siddons, and the daughter could make nothing of
the Scotch Novels, but admired Mr. Theodore Hook’s ‘<span class='sc'>Sayings
and Doings</span>!’</p>

<p class='c013'>Northcote then returned to the subject of his book and said, ‘Sir
Richard Phillips once wished me to do a very magnificent work
indeed on the subject of art. He was like Curil, who had a number
of fine title-pages, if any one could have written books to answer
them. He came here once with Godwin to shew me a picture
which they had just discovered of Chaucer, and which was to
embellish Godwin’s <cite>Life</cite> of him. I told them it was certainly no
picture of Chaucer, nor was any such picture painted at that time.’
I said, Godwin had got a portrait about a year ago which he wished
me to suppose was a likeness of President Bradshaw: I saw no
reason for his thinking so, but that in that case it would be worth a
hundred pounds to him! Northcote expressed a curiosity to have
seen it, as he knew the descendants of the family at Plymouth. He
remembered one of them, an old lady of the name of Wilcox, who
used to walk about in Gibson’s-Field near the town, so prim and
starched, holding up her fan spread out like a peacock’s tail with such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>an air, on account of her supposed relationship to one of the Regicides!
They paid, however (in the vulgar opinion) for this distinction; for
others of them bled to death at the nose, or died of the bursting of a
blood-vessel, which their wise neighbours did not fail to consider as a
judgment upon them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Speaking of Dr. M—, he said, he had such a feeling of beauty
in his heart, that it made angels of every one around him. To check
a person who was running on against another, he once said, ‘You
should not speak in that manner, for you lead me to suppose you have
the bad qualities you are so prone to dwell upon in others.’—A
transition was here made to Lord Byron, who used to tell a story of
a little red-haired girl, who, when countesses and ladies of fashion
were leaving the room where he was in crowds (to <em>cut</em> him after his
quarrel with his wife) stopped short near a table against which he
was leaning, gave him a familiar nod, and said, ‘You should have
married me, and then this would not have happened to you!’ A
question being started whether Dr. M— was handsome, Northcote
answered, ‘I could see no beauty in him as to his outward person,
but there was an angelic sweetness of disposition that spread its
influence over his whole conversation and manner. He had not wit,
but a fine romantic enthusiasm which deceived himself and enchanted
others. I remember once his describing a picture by Rosa de Tivoli
(at Saltram) of <cite>Two Bulls fighting</cite>, and he gave such an account of
their rage and manner of tearing up the ground that I could not rest
till we went over to see it—when we came there, it was nothing but
a coarse daub like what might be expected from the painter: but he
had made the rest out of a vivid imagination. So my father told
him a story of a bull-bait he had seen in which the bull had run so
furiously at the dog that he broke the chain and pitched upon his
head and was killed. Soon after, he came and told us the same
story as an incident he himself had witnessed. He did not mean to
deceive, but the image had made such an impression on his fancy,
that he believed it to be one that he had himself been an eye-witness
of.’ I was much amused with this account and I offered to get him
a copy of a whimsical production, of which a new edition had been
printed. I also recommended to him the <cite>Spanish Rogue</cite>, as a fine
mixture of drollery and grave moralizing. He spoke of <cite>Lazarillo de
Tormes</cite> and of the <cite>Cheats of Scapin</cite>, the last of which he rated rather
low. The work was written by Scarron, whose widow, the famous
Madame de Maintenon, afterwards became mistress to Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span></p>

  <h3 class='c008'>PART THE SECOND</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE SIXTEENTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>N.—That is your diffidence, which I can’t help thinking you
carry too far. For any one of real strength, you are the humblest
person I ever knew.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—It is owing to pride.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—You deny you have invention too. But it is want of practice.
Your ideas run on before your executive power. It is a common
case. There was Ramsay, of whom Sir Joshua used to say that he
was the most sensible among all the painters of his time; but he has
left little to show it. His manner was dry and timid. He stopped
short in the middle of his work, because he knew exactly how much
it wanted. Now and then we find hints and sketches which show
what he might have been, if his hand had been equal to his conceptions.
I have seen a picture of his of the Queen, soon after she was
married—a profile, and slightly done; but it was a paragon of
elegance. She had a fan in her hand: Lord! how she held that fan!
It was weak in execution and ordinary in features—all I can say of
it is, that it was the farthest possible removed from everything like
vulgarity. A professor might despise it; but in the mental part, I
have never seen any thing of Vandyke’s equal to it. I could have
looked at it forever. I showed it to J—n; and he, I believe, came
into my opinion of it. I don’t know where it is now; but I saw in
it enough to convince me that Sir Joshua was right in what he said
of Ramsay’s great superiority. His own picture of the King, which
is at the Academy, is a finer composition and shows greater boldness
and mastery of hand; but I should find it difficult to produce any
thing of Sir Joshua’s that conveys an idea of more grace and delicacy
than the one I have mentioned. Reynolds would have finished it
better: the other was afraid of spoiling what he had done, and so left
it a mere outline. He was frightened before he was hurt.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Taste and even genius is but a misfortune, without a correspondent
degree of manual dexterity or power of language to make it
manifest.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—W— was here the other day. I believe you met him
going out. He came, he said, to ask me about the famous people of
the last age, Johnson, Burke, &amp;c. (as I was almost the only person
left who remembered them), and was curious to know what figure
Sir Walter Scott would have made among them.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>H.—That is so like a North-Briton—‘to make assurance doubly
sure,’ and to procure a signature to an acknowledged reputation as if
it were a receipt for the delivery of a bale of goods.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I told him it was not for me to pronounce upon such men as
Sir Walter Scott: they came before another tribunal. They were of
that height that they were seen by all the world, and must stand or
fall by the verdict of posterity. It signified little what any individual
thought in such cases, it being equally an impertinence to set one’s
self against or to add one’s testimony to the public voice; but as far
as I could judge, I told him, that Sir Walter would have stood his
ground in any company: neither Burke nor Johnson nor any of their
admirers would have been disposed or able to set aside his pretensions.
These men were not looked upon in their day as they are at present:
Johnson had his <cite>Lexiphanes</cite>, and Goldsmith was laughed at—their
merits were to the full as much called in question, nay, more so, than
those of the Author of <cite>Waverley</cite> have ever been, who has been
singularly fortunate in himself or in lighting upon a barren age: but
because their names have since become established, and as it were
sacred, we think they were always so; and W— wanted me, as a
competent witness and as having seen both parties, to affix the same
seal to his countryman’s reputation, which it is not in the power of
the whole of the present generation to do, much less of any single
person in it. No, we must wait for this! Time alone can give the
final stamp: no living reputation can ever be of the same value or
quality as posthumous fame. We must throw lofty objects to a
distance in order to judge of them: if we are standing close under
the Monument, it looks higher than St. Paul’s. Posterity has this
advantage over us-not that they are really wiser, but they see the
proportions better from being placed further off. For instance, I liked
Sir Walter, because he had an easy, unaffected manner, and was ready
to converse on all subjects alike. He was not like your friends, the
L— poets, who talk about nothing but their own poetry. If, on
the contrary, he had been stiff and pedantic, I should, perhaps, have
been inclined to think less highly of the author from not liking the
man; so that we can never judge fairly of men’s abilities till we
are no longer liable to come in contact with their persons. Friends
are as little to be trusted as enemies: favour or prejudice makes the
votes in either case more or less suspected; though ‘the vital signs
that a name shall live’ are in some instances so strong, that we can
hardly refuse to put faith in them, and I think this is one. I was
much pleased with Sir Walter, and I believe he expressed a favourable
opinion of me. I said to him, ‘I admire the way in which you
begin your novels. You set out so abruptly, that you quite surprise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>me. I can’t at all tell what’s coming.’—‘No!’ says Sir Walter,
‘nor I neither.’ I then told him, that when I first read <cite>Waverley</cite>, I
said it was no novel: nobody could invent like that. Either he had
heard the story related by one of the surviving parties, or he had
found the materials in a manuscript concealed in some old chest: to
which he replied, ‘You’re not so far out of the way in thinking so.’
You don’t know him, do you? He’d be a pattern to you. Oh! he
has a very fine manner. You would learn to rub off some of your
asperities. But you admire him, I believe.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Yes; on this side of idolatry and Toryism.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—That is your prejudice.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Nay, it rather shows my liberality, if I am a devoted
enthusiast, notwithstanding. There are two things I admire in Sir
Walter, his capacity and his simplicity; which indeed I am apt to think
are much the same. The more ideas a man has of other things, the
less he is taken up with the idea of himself. Every one gives the
same account of the author of <cite>Waverley</cite> in this respect. When he
was in Paris, and went to Galignani’s, he sat down in an outer room
to look at some book he wanted to see: none of the clerks had the
least suspicion who it was: when it was found out, the place was in
a commotion. Cooper, the American, was in Paris at the same
time: his looks and manners seemed to announce a much greater
man. He strutted through the streets with a very consequential air;
and in company held up his head, screwed up his features, and placed
himself on a sort of pedestal to be observed and admired, as if he
never relaxed in the assumption nor wished it to be forgotten by
others, that he was the American Sir Walter Scott. The real one
never troubled himself about the matter. Why should he? He
might safely leave that question to others. Indeed, by what I am
told, he carries his indifference too far: it amounts to an implied contempt
for the public, and <em>misprision of treason</em> against the commonwealth
of letters. He thinks nothing of his works, although ‘all
Europe rings with them from side to side.’—If so, he has been
severely punished for his infirmity.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Though you do not know Sir Walter Scott, I think I have
heard you say you have seen him.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Yes, he put me in mind of Cobbett, with his florid face and
scarlet gown, which were just like the other’s red face and scarlet
waistcoat. The one is like an English farmer, the other like a
Scotch <em>laird</em>. Both are large, robust men, with great strength and
composure of features; but I saw nothing of the <em>ideal</em> character
in the romance-writer, any more than I looked for it in the
politician.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>N.—Indeed! But you have a vast opinion of Cobbett too, haven’t
you? Oh! he’s a giant! He has such prodigious strength; he
tears up a subject by the roots. Did you ever read his Grammar?
Or see his attack on Mrs. —? It was like a hawk pouncing on a
wren. I should be terribly afraid to get into his hands. And then
his homely, familiar way of writing—it is not from necessity or
vulgarity, but to show his contempt for aristocratic pride and
arrogance. He only has a kitchen-garden; he could have a flower-garden
too if he chose. Peter Pindar said his style was like the
Horse-Guards, only one story above the ground, while Junius’s had
all the airy elegance of Whitehall: but he could raise his style just as
high as he pleased; though he does not want to sacrifice strength to
elegance. He knows better what he is about.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I don’t think he’ll set up for a fine gentleman in a hurry,
though he has for a Member of Parliament; and I fancy he would
make no better figure in the one than the other. He appeared to me,
when I once saw him, exactly what I expected: in Sir Walter I
looked in vain for a million of fine things! I could only explain it
to myself in this way, that there was a degree of capacity in that huge
double forehead of his, that superseded all effort, made every thing
come intuitively and almost mechanically, as if it were merely
transcribing what was already written, and by the very facility with
which the highest beauty and excellence was produced, left few
traces of it in the expression of the countenance, and hardly any sense
of it in the mind of the author. Expression only comes into the face
as we are at a loss for words, or have a difficulty in bringing forward
our ideas; but we may repeat the finest things by rote without any
change of look or manner. It is only when the powers are tasked,
when the moulds of thought are full, that the effect or the <em>wear-and-tear</em>
of the mind appears on the surface. So, in general, writers of
the greatest imagination and range of ideas, and who might be said to
have all nature obedient to their call, seem to have been most careless
of their fame and regardless of their works. They treat their productions
not as children, but as ‘bastards of their art;’ whereas those
who are more confined in their scope of intellect and wedded to some
one theory or predominant fancy, have been found to feel a proportionable
fondness for the offspring of their brain, and have thus
excited a deeper interest in it in the minds of others. We set a
value on things as they have cost us dear: the very limitation of our
faculties or exclusiveness of our feelings compels us to concentrate all
our enthusiasm on a favourite subject; and strange as it may sound,
in order to inspire a perfect sympathy in others or to form a school,
men must themselves be <em>egotists</em>! Milton has had fewer readers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>admirers, but I suspect more devoted and bigotted ones, than ever
Shakspeare had: Sir Walter Scott has attracted more universal
attention than any writer of our time, but you may speak against him
with less danger of making personal enemies than if you attack Lord
Byron. Even Wordsworth has half a dozen followers, who set him
up above everybody else from a <em>common idiosyncrasy</em> of feeling and the
singleness of the elements of which his excellence is composed.
Before we can take an author entirely to our bosoms, he must be
another self; and he cannot be this, if he is ‘not one, but all
mankind’s epitome.’ It was this which gave such an effect to
Rousseau’s writings, that he stamped his own character and the
image of his self-love on the public mind—<em>there</em> it is, and there it will
remain in spite of every thing. Had he possessed more comprehension
of thought or feeling, it would have only have diverted him from his
object. But it was the excess of his egotism and his utter blindness
to every thing else, that found a corresponding sympathy in the conscious
feelings of every human breast, and shattered to pieces the
pride of rank and circumstance by the pride of internal worth or
upstart pretension. When Rousseau stood behind the chair of the
master of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</span></i> of —, and smiled to hear the company
dispute about the meaning of the motto of the arms of the family,
which he alone knew, and stumbled as he handed the glass of wine
to his young mistress, and fancied she coloured at being waited upon
by so learned a young footman—then was first kindled that spark
which can never be quenched, then was formed the germ of that
strong conviction of the disparity between the badge on his shoulder
and the aspirations of his soul—the determination, in short, that
external situation and advantages are but the mask, and that the mind
is the man—armed with which, impenetrable, incorrigible, he went
forth conquering and to conquer, and overthrew the monarchy of
France and the hierarchies of the earth. Till then, birth and wealth
and power were all in all, though but the frame-work or crust that
envelopes the man; and what there was in the man himself was never
asked, or was scorned and forgot. And while all was dark and
grovelling within, while knowledge either did not exist or was
confined to a few, while material power and advantages were every
thing, this was naturally to be expected. But with the increase and
diffusion of knowledge, this state of things must sooner or later
cease; and Rousseau was the first who held the torch (lighted at
the never-dying fire in his own bosom) to the hidden chambers of the
mind of man—like another Prometheus, breathed into his nostrils the
breath of a new and intellectual life, enraging the Gods of the earth,
and made him feel what is due to himself and his fellows. Before,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>physical force was every thing: henceforward, mind, thought, feeling
was a new element—a fourth estate in society. What! shall a man
have read Dante and Ariosto, and be none the better for it? Shall
he be still judged of only by his coat, the number of his servants in
livery, the house over his head? While poverty meant ignorance,
that was necessarily the case; but the world of books overturns the
world of things, and establishes a new balance of power and scale of
estimation. Shall we think only rank and pedigree divine, when we
have music, poetry, and painting within us? Tut! we have read
<cite>Old Mortality</cite>; and shall it be asked whether we have done so in a
garret or a palace, in a carriage or on foot? Or knowing them, shall
we not revere the mighty heirs of fame, and respect ourselves for
knowing and honouring them? This is the true march of intellect, and
not the erection of <cite>Mechanics’ Institutions</cite>, or the printing of <em>two-penny
trash</em>, according to my notion of the matter, though I have nothing to
say against them neither.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I thought you never would have done; however, you have
come to the ground at last. After this rhapsody, I must inform you
that Rousseau is a character more detestable to me than I have power
of language to express:—an aristocrat filled with all their worst vices,
pride, ambition, conceit and gross affectation: and though endowed
with some ability, yet not sufficient ever to make him know right
from wrong: witness his novel of <cite>Eloisa</cite>. His name brings to my
mind all the gloomy horrors of a mob-government, which attempted
from their ignorance to banish truth and justice from the world. I
see you place Sir Walter above Lord Byron. The question is not
which keeps longest on the wing, but which soars highest: and
I cannot help thinking there are essences in Lord Byron that are not
to be surpassed. He is on a par with Dryden. All the other
modern poets appear to me vulgar in the comparison. As a lady
who comes here said, there is such an air of nobility in what he
writes. Then there is such a power in the style, expressions almost
like Shakspeare—‘And looked round on them with their <em>wolfish</em>
eyes.’</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—The expression is in Shakspeare, somewhere in <cite>Lear</cite>.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—The line I repeated is in <cite>Don Juan</cite>. I do not mean to
vindicate the immorality or misanthropy in that poem—perhaps his
lameness was to blame for this defect—but surely no one can deny
the force, the spirit of it; and there is such a fund of drollery
mixed up with the serious part. Nobody understood the tragi-comedy
of poetry so well. People find fault with this mixture in
general, because it is not well managed; there is a comic story and
a tragic story going on at the same time, without their having any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>thing to do with one another. But in Lord Byron they are brought
together, just as they are in nature. In like manner, if you go to
an execution at the very moment when the criminal is going to be
turned off, and all eyes are fixed upon him, an old apple-woman
and her stall are overturned, and all the spectators fall a-laughing.
In real life the most ludicrous incidents border on the most affecting
and shocking. How fine that is of the cask of butter in the storm!
Some critics have objected to it as turning the whole into burlesque;
on the contrary, it is that which stamps the character of the scene
more than any thing else. What did the people in the boat care
about the rainbow, which he has described in such vivid colours;
or even about their fellow-passengers who were thrown overboard,
when they only wanted to eat them? No, it was the loss of the
firkin of butter that affected them more than all the rest; and it
is the mention of this circumstance that adds a hardened levity and
a sort of ghastly horror to the scene. It shows the master-hand—there
is such a boldness and sagacity and superiority to ordinary
rules in it! I agree, however, in your admiration of the Waverley
Novels: they are very fine. As I told the author, he and Cervantes
have raised the idea of human nature, not as Richardson has attempted,
by affectation and a false varnish, but by bringing out what there is really
fine in it under a cloud of disadvantages. Have you seen the last?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—No.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—There is a character of a common smith or armourer in it,
which, in spite of a number of weaknesses and in the most ludicrous
situations, is made quite heroical by the tenderness and humanity it
displays. It is his best, but I had not read it when I saw him.
No; all that can be said against Sir Walter is, that he has never
made a <em>whole</em>. There is an infinite number of delightful incidents
and characters, but they are disjointed and scattered. This is one
of Fielding’s merits: his novels are regular compositions, with what
the ancients called a <em>beginning</em>, a <em>middle</em>, and an <em>end</em>: every circumstance
is foreseen and provided for, and the conclusion of the story
turns round as it were to meet the beginning. <cite>Gil Blas</cite> is very
clever, but it is only a succession of chapters. <cite>Tom Jones</cite> is a
masterpiece, as far as regards the conduct of the fable.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Do you know the reason? Fielding had a hooked nose,
the long chin. It is that introverted physiognomy that binds and
concentrates.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—But Sir Walter has not a hooked nose, but one that denotes
kindness and ingenuity. Mrs. Abington had the pug-nose, who
was the perfection of comic archness and vivacity: a hooked nose
is my aversion.</p>

  <h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE SEVENTEENTH</h4>
</div>

<p class='c009'>N.—I sometimes get into scrapes that way by contradicting people
before I have well considered the subject, and I often wonder how
I get out of them so well as I do. I remember once meeting with
Sir — —, who was talking about Milton; and as I have a
natural aversion to a coxcomb, I differed from what he said, without
being at all prepared with any arguments in support of my
opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—But you had time enough to think of them afterwards.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I got through with it somehow or other. It is the very
risk you run in such cases that puts you on the alert and gives you
spirit to extricate yourself from it. If you had full leisure to
deliberate and to make out your defence beforehand, you perhaps
could not do it so well as on the spur of the occasion. The surprise
and flutter of the animal spirits gives the alarm to any little wit we
possess, and puts it into a state of immediate requisition.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Besides, it is always easiest to defend a paradox or an
opinion you don’t care seriously about. I would sooner (as a
matter of choice) take the wrong side than the right in any argument.
If you have a thorough conviction on any point and good grounds
for it, you have studied it long, and the real reasons have sunk into
the mind; so that what you can recal of them at a sudden <em>pinch</em>,
seems unsatisfactory and disproportionate to the confidence of your
belief and to the magisterial tone you are disposed to assume. Even
truth is a matter of habit and professorship. Reason and knowledge,
when at their height, return into a kind of instinct. We understand
the grammar of a foreign language best, though we do not speak it
so well. But if you take up an opinion at a venture, then you lay
hold of whatever excuse comes within your reach, instead of searching
about for and bewildering yourself with the true reasons; and
the odds are that the arguments thus got up are as good as those
opposed to them. In fact, the more sophistical and superficial an
objection to a received or well-considered opinion is, the more we
are staggered and teazed by it; and the next thing is to lose our
temper, when we become an easy prey to a cool and disingenuous
adversary. I would much rather (as the safest side) insist on
Milton’s pedantry than on his sublimity, supposing I were not in
the company of very good judges. A single stiff or obscure line
would outweigh a whole book of solemn grandeur in the mere
flippant encounter of the wits, and, in general, the truth and justice
of the cause you espouse is rather an incumbrance than an assistance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>or it is like heavy armour which few have strength to wield. Any
thing short of complete triumph on the right side is defeat: any
hole picked or flaw detected in an argument which we are holding
earnestly and conscientiously, is sufficient to raise the laugh against
us. This is the greatest advantage which folly and knavery have.
We are not satisfied to be right, unless we can prove others to be
quite wrong; and as all the world would be thought to have some
reason on their side, they are glad of any loop-hole or pretext to
escape from the dogmatism and tyranny we would set up over them.
Absolute submission requires absolute proofs. Without some such
drawback, the world might become too wise and too good, at least
according to every man’s private prescription. In this sense <em>ridicule
is the test of truth</em>; that is, the levity and indifference on one side
balances the formality and presumption on the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Horne Tooke used to play with his antagonists in the way
you speak of. He constantly threw Fuseli into a rage and made
him a laughing-stock, by asking him to explain the commonest things,
and often what Fuseli understood much better than he did. But in
general, I think it is less an indifference to truth than the fear of
finding yourself in the wrong, that carries you through when you
take up any opinion from caprice or the spirit of contradiction.
Danger almost always produces courage and presence of mind. The
faculties are called forth with the occasion. You see men of very
ordinary characters, placed in extraordinary circumstances, act like
men of capacity. The late King of France was thought weak and
imbecile, till he was thrown into the most trying situations; and then
he shewed sense and even eloquence which no one had ever suspected.
Events supplied the want of genius and energy; the external impressions
were so strong, that the dullest or most indolent must have
been roused by them. Indeed the wise man is perhaps more liable
to err in such extreme cases by setting up his own preconceptions
and self-will against circumstances, than the <em>common-place</em> character
who yields to necessity and is passive under existing exigencies. It
is this which makes kings and ministers equal to their situations.
They may be very poor creatures in themselves; but the importance
of the part they have to act and the magnitude of their responsibility
inspire them with a factitious and <em>official</em> elevation of view. Few
people are found totally unfit for high station, and it is lucky that
it is so. Perhaps men of genius and imagination are the least
adapted to get into the state go-cart; Buonaparte, we see, with all
his talent, only drove to the devil. When Richard <span class='fss'>II.</span> was quite
a youth, and he went to suppress the rebellion of Wat Tyler in
Smithfield, and the latter was killed, his followers drew their bows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>and were about to take vengeance on the young king, when he
stepped forward and said that ‘now as their leader was dead, he
would be their leader.’ This instantly disarmed their rage, and
they received him with acclamations. He had no other course
left; the peril he was in made him see his place of safety. Courage
has a wonderful effect: this makes mad people so terrible, that they
have no fear. Even wild beasts or a mob (which is much the
same thing) will hardly dare to attack you if you show no fear of
them. I have heard Lord Exmouth (Sir Edward Pellew) say
that once when he was out with his ship at sea and there was a
mutiny on board and no chance of escape, he learned (from a spy
he had among them) the moment when the ring-leaders were
assembled and about to execute their design of putting the captain
and all the officers to death, when taking a pistol in each hand,
he went down into the cock-pit into the midst of them; and
threatening to shoot the first man that stirred, took them every one
prisoners. If he had betrayed the least fear or any of them had
raised a hand, he must have been instantly sacrificed. But he was
bolder than any individual in the group, and by this circumstance
had the ascendancy over the whole put together. A similar act of
courage is related of Peter the Great, who singly entered the haunt
of some conspirators, and striking down the leader with a blow on
the face, spread consternation amongst the assassins, who were
terrified by his fearlessness.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—It is curious to what perfection these things are brought,
and how cheap they are. It is that which makes them sell and
ensures the fortune of those who publish them. Great fortunes
are made out of small profits, which allow all the world to become
purchasers. That is the reason the Colosseum will hardly answer.
There never was an example of an exhibition in England answering
at a crown a-piece. People look twice at their money before they
will part with it, if it be more than they are accustomed to pay. It
becomes a question, and perhaps a few stragglers go; whereas they
ought to go in a stream and as a matter of course. If people have
to pay a little more than usual, though a mere trifle, they consider
it in the light of an imposition, and resent it as such; if the price
be a little under the mark, they think they have saved so much
money, and snap at it as a bargain. The publishers of the work
on Edinburgh are the same who brought out the <cite>Views of London</cite>;
and it is said, the success of that undertaking enabled them to buy up
Lackington’s business. E— the architect, I am told, suggested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>the plan, but declined a share that was offered him in it, because he
said nothing that he had been engaged in had ever succeeded. The
event would not belie the notion of his own ill-luck. It is singular
on what slight turns good or ill fortune depends. Lackington (I
understood from the person who brought the <cite>Edinburgh Views</cite> here)
died worth near half a million: nobody could tell how he had made
it. At thirty he was not worth a shilling. The great difficulty is

A difference of sixpence in the price will make all the difference in the
sale of a book. Sometimes a work lies on the shelf for a time, and
then runs like wild-fire. There was <cite>Drelincourt on Death</cite>, which is a
fortune in itself; it hung on hand; <em>nobody</em> read it, till Defoe put
a ghost-story into it, and it has been a stock-book ever since. It is
the same in prints. A catching subject or name will make one thing
an universal favourite, while another of ten times the merit is never
noticed. I have known this happen to myself in more than one
instance. This is the provoking part in W—l  and some other
painters, who, taking advantage of the externals and accidents of
their art, have run away with nearly all the popularity of their time.
Jack T— was here the other day to say that W— and his
friends complained bitterly of the things I said about him. I replied
that I had only spoken of him as an artist, which I was at liberty to
do; and that if he were offended, I would recommend to him to
read the story of Charles II. and the Duchess of Cleveland, who
came to the king with a complaint, that whenever she met Nell
Gwyn in the street, the latter put her head out of the coach and
made mouths at her. ‘Well then,’says Charles II. ‘the next time
you meet Nelly and she repeats the offence, do you make mouths at her
again!’ So if Mr. W—l is hurt at my saying things of him, all
he has to do is to say things of me in return.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I confess, I never liked W—1. It was one of the errors
of my youth that I did not think him equal to Raphael and Rubens
united, as Payne Knight contended: and I have fought many a battle
with numbers (if not odds) against me on that point.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Then you must have the satisfaction of seeing a change of
opinion at present.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Pardon me, I have not that satisfaction; I have only a
double annoyance from it. It is no consolation to me that an
individual was overrated by the folly of the public formerly, and that
he suffers from their injustice and fickleness at present. It is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>satisfaction to me that poor I—g is reduced to his primitive congregation,
and that the stream of coronet-coaches no longer rolls
down Holborn or Oxford-street to his chapel. They ought never to
have done so, or they ought to continue to do so. The world (whatever
in their petulance and profligacy they may think) have no right to
intoxicate poor human nature with the full tide of popular applause,
and then to drive it to despair for the want of it. There are no words
to express the cruelty, the weakness, the shamelessness of such
conduct, which resembles that of the little girl who dresses up her
doll in the most extravagant finery, and then in mere wantonness
strips it naked to its wool and bits of wood again—with this
difference that the doll has no feeling, whereas the world’s idols
are wholly sensitive.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I can understand the character, because it is exactly the
reverse of what I should do and feel. It is like dressing out of one’s
sphere, or any other species of affectation and imposture. I cannot
bear to be taken for any thing but what I am. It is like what the
country-people call ‘having <em>a halfpenny head and a farthing tail</em>.’
That is what makes me mad when people sometimes come and pay
their court to me by saying—‘Bless me! how sagacious you look!
What a penetrating countenance! ‘No, I say, that is but the title-page—what
is there in the book? Your dwelling so much on the
exterior seems to imply that the inside does not correspond to it.
Don’t let me look wise and be foolish, but let me be wise though I
am taken for a fool! Any thing else is quackery: it is as if there
was no real excellence in the world, but in opinion. I used to blame
Sir Joshua for this: he sometimes wanted to get <em>Collins’s earth</em>, but
did not like to have it known. Then there were certain oils that he
made a great <em>fuss</em> and mystery about. I have said to myself, surely
there is something deeper and nobler in the art that does not depend
on all this trick and handicraft. Give Titian and a common painter
the same materials and tools to work with, and then see the difference
between them. This is all that is worth contending for. If Sir
Joshua had had no other advantage than the using <em>Collins’s earth</em> and
some particular sort of <em>megilp</em>, we should not now have been talking
about him. When W— was here the other day, he asked about
Mengs and his school; and when I told him what I thought, he
said, ‘Is that your own opinion, or did you take it from Sir Joshua?’
I answered, that if I admired Sir Joshua, it was because there was
something congenial in our tastes, and not because I was his pupil. I
saw his faults, and differed with him often enough. If I have any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>bias, it is the other way, to take fancies into my head and run into
singularity and cavils. In what I said to you about Ramsay’s picture
of the Queen, for instance, I don’t know that any one ever thought
so before, or that any one else would agree with me. It might be
set down as mere whim and caprice; but I can’t help it, if it is so.
All I know is, that such is my feeling about it, which I can no more
part with than I can part with my own existence. It is the same in
other things, as in music. There was an awkward composer at the
Opera many years ago, of the name of Boccarelli; what he did was
stupid enough in general, but I remember he sung an air one day at
Cosway’s, which they said Shield had transferred into the <cite>Flitch of
Bacon</cite>. I cannot describe the effect it had upon me—it seemed as if
it wound into my very soul—I would give any thing to hear it sung
again. So I could have listened to Dignum’s singing the lines out of
Shakspeare—‘Come unto these yellow sands, and then take hands’—a
hundred times over. But I am not sure that others would be
affected in the same manner by it: there may be some quaint
association of ideas in the case. But at least, if I am wrong, the
folly is my own.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—There is no danger of the sort, except from affectation,
which I am sure is not your case. All the real taste and feeling in
the world is made up of what people <em>take in their heads</em> in this
manner. Even if you were right only once in five times in these
hazardous experiments and shrewd guesses, that would be a fifth
part of the truth; whereas, if you merely repeated after others by
rote or waited to have all the world on your side, there could be
absolutely nothing gained at all. If any one had come in and had
expressed the same idea of Ramsay’s portrait of the Queen, this
would doubtless be a confirmation of your opinion, like two persons
finding out a likeness; but suppose W— had gone away with your
opinion in his pocket, and had spread it about everywhere what a
fine painter Ramsay was, I do not see how this would have
strengthened your conclusion; nay, perhaps the people whom he got
as converts would entirely mistake the meaning, and come to you
with the very reverse of what you had said as a prodigious discovery.
This is the way in which these unanimous verdicts are commonly
obtained. You might say that Ramsay was not a fine painter, but a
man of real genius. The world, not comprehending the distinction,
would merely come to the gross conclusion, that he was both one and
the other. Thus even truth is vulgarly debased into <em>common-place</em>
and nonsense. So that it is not simply as Mr. Locke observed—‘That
there are not so many wrong opinions in the world as is
generally imagined, for most people have no opinion at all, but take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>up with those of others or with mere hearsay and echoes;’ but these
echoes are often false ones and no more like the original idea than
the rhyming echoes in Hudibras or than Slender’s Mum and
Budget.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—But don’t you think the contrary extreme would be just as
bad, if every one set up to judge for himself and every question was
split into an endless variety of opinions?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I do not see that this would follow. If persons who are
sincere and free to inquire differ widely on any subject, it is because
it is beyond their reach, and there is no satisfactory evidence one way or
the other. Supposing a thing to be doubtful, why should it not be
left so? But men’s passions and interests, when brought into play, are
most tenacious on these points where their understandings afford them
least light. Those doctrines are <em>established</em> which need propping up,
as men place beams against falling houses. It does not require an
act of parliament to persuade mathematicians to agree with Euclid, or
painters to admire Raphael.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—And don’t you think this the best rule for the rest of the
world to go by?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Yes; but not if the doctors themselves differed: then it
would be necessary to <em>clench the nail</em> with a few smart strokes of
bigotry and intolerance. What admits of proof, men agree in, if they
have no interest to the contrary; what they differ about in spite of
all that can be said, is matter of taste or conjecture.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE EIGHTEENTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>N.—Opie, I remember, used to argue, that there were as many
different sorts of taste as genius. He said, ‘If I am engaged in a
picture, and endeavour to do it according to the suggestions of my
employers, I do not understand exactly what they want, nor they
what I can do, and I please no one: but if I do it according to my
own notions, I belong to a class, and if I am able to satisfy myself, I
please that class.’ You did not know Opie? You would have
admired him greatly. I do not speak of him as an artist, but as a
man of sense and observation. He paid me the compliment of saying,
‘that we should have been the best friends in the world, if we had
not been rivals.’ I think he had more of this feeling than I had;
perhaps, because I had most vanity. We sometimes got into foolish
altercations. I recollect once in particular, at a banker’s in the city,
we took up the whole of dinner-time with a ridiculous controversy
about Milton and Shakspeare; I am sure we neither of us had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>least notion which was right—and when I was heartily ashamed of it,
a foolish citizen who was present, added to my confusion by saying—‘Lord!
What would I give to hear two such men as you talk
every day!’ This quite humbled me: I was ready to sink with
vexation: I could have resolved never to open my mouth again.
But I can’t help thinking W— was wrong in supposing I borrow
every thing from others. It is not my character. I never could
learn my lesson at school. My copy was hardly legible; but if there
was a prize to be obtained or my father was to see it, then I could
write a very fine hand with all the usual flourishes. What I know
of history (and something about heraldry) has been gathered up
when I had to enquire into the subject for a picture: if it had been
set me as a task, I should have forgotten it immediately. In the
same way, when Boydell came and proposed a subject for a picture
to me, and pointed out the capabilities, I always said I could make
nothing of it: but as soon as he was gone and I was left to myself,
the whole then seemed to unfold itself naturally. I never could study
the rules of composition or make sketches and drawings beforehand;
in this, probably running into the opposite error to that of the modern
Italian painters, whom Fuseli reproaches with spending their whole
lives in preparation. I must begin at once or I can do nothing.
When I set about the ‘Wat Tyler,’ I was frightened at it: it was
the largest work I had ever undertaken: there were to be horses and
armour and buildings and several groups in it: when I looked at it,
the canvas seemed ready to fall upon me. But I had committed
myself and could not escape; disgrace was behind me—and every
step I made in advance, was so much positively gained. If I had
staid to make a number of designs and try different experiments, I
never should have had the courage to go on. Half the things that
people do not succeed in, are through fear of making the attempt.
Like the recruit in Farquhar’s comedy, you grow wondrous bold,
when you have once taken ‘list-money.’ When you <em>must</em> do a thing,
you feel in some measure that you <em>can</em> do it. You have only to commit
yourself beyond retreat. It is like the soldier going into battle
or a player first appearing on the stage—the worst is over when they
arrive upon the scene of action.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I found nearly the same thing that you describe when I first
began to write for the newspapers. I had not till then been in the
habit of writing at all, or had been a long time about it; but I perceived
that with the necessity, the fluency came. Something I did,
<em>took</em>; and I was called upon to do a number of things all at once.
I was in the middle of the stream, and must sink or swim. I had,
for instance, often a theatrical criticism to write after midnight, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>appeared the next morning. There was no fault found with it—at
least, it was as good as if I had had to do it for a weekly paper. I
only did it at once, and recollected all I had to say on the spot,
because I could not put it off for three days, when perhaps I should
have forgotten the best part of it. Besides, when one is pressed for
time, one saves it. I might set down nearly all I had to say in my
mind, while the play was going on. I know I did not feel at a loss
for matter—the difficulty was to compress and write it out fast
enough. When you are tied to time, you can come to time. I
conceive in like manner more wonder is expressed at <em>extempore</em>
speaking, than it is entitled to. Not to mention that the same well-known
topics continually recur, and that the speakers may con their
<em>extempore</em> speeches over beforehand and merely watch their opportunity
to slide them in dexterously into the grand procession of the
debate: a man when once on his legs <em>must say something</em>, and this is
the utmost that a public speaker generally says. If he has any thing
good to say, he can recollect it just as well at once as in a week’s
literary leisure, as well standing up as sitting down, except from habit.
We are not surprised at a man’s telling us his thoughts across a table:
why should we be so at his doing the same thing, when mounted on
one? But he excites more attention: <em>that</em> gives him a double
motive. A man’s getting up to make a speech in public will not
give him a command of words or thoughts if he is without them;
but he may be delivered of all the brilliancy or wisdom he actually
possesses, in a longer or a shorter space, according to the occasion.
The circumstance of the time is optional; necessity, if it be not the
mother of invention, supplies us with the memory of all we know.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—(<em>after a pause</em>)—There is no end of the bigotry and prejudice
in the world; one can only shrug one’s shoulders and submit to it.
Have you seen the copies they have got down at the club-house in
Pall-mall of the groups of horses from the Elgin marbles? Lord!
how inferior they are to Rubens’s! So stiff, and poor, and dry,
compared to his magnificent spirit and bold luxuriance! I should
not know them to be horses; they are as much like any thing else.
I was at Somerset-house the other day. They talk of the Dutch
painters; why, there are pictures there of interiors and other subjects
of familiar life, that throw all the boasted <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></i> of the Dutch
school to an immeasurable distance. I do not speak of history, which
has not been fairly tried; but in all for which there has been
encouragement, no nation can go beyond us. We have resources
and a richness of capacity equal to any undertaking.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Do you recollect any in particular that you admired at the
Exhibition?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>N.—No, I do not remember the names; but it was a general
sense of excellence and truth of imitation of natural objects. As to
lofty history, our religion scarcely allows it. The Italians had no
more genius for painting nor a greater love of pictures than we; but
the <em>church</em> was the foster-mother of the fine arts; being the most
politic and powerful establishment in the world, they laid their hands
on all that could allure and impress the minds of the people—music,
painting, architecture, ceremonies; and this produced a succession of
great artists and noble works, till the churches were filled, and then
they ceased. The genius of Italian art was nothing but the genius of
Popery. God forbid we should purchase success at the same price!
Every thing at Rome is like a picture—is calculated for show. I
remember walking through one of the bye-streets near the Vatican,
where I met some procession in which the Pope was; and all at once
I saw a number of the most beautiful Arabian horses curvetting and
throwing out their long tails, like a vision or a part of a romance.
We should here get one or two at most. All our holiday pageants,
even the Coronation, are low Bartlemy-fair exhibitions compared with
what you see at Rome. And then to see the Pope give the benediction
at St. Peter’s, raising himself up and spreading out his hands in
the form of a cross, with an energy and dignity as if he was giving
a blessing to the whole world! No, it is not enough to <em>see</em> Popery
in order to hate it—it must be felt too. A poor man going through
one of the narrow streets where a similar procession was passing, was
fiercely attacked by a soldier of the Swiss Guards, and ordered to
stand back. The man said he could retire no further, for he was
close against the wall. ‘Get back, you and the wall too!’ was the
answer of haughty servility and mild despotism. It is this spirit
peeping out that makes one dread the fairest outside appearances; and
with this spirit, and the power and determination it implies to delude
and lead the multitude blindfold with every lure to their imagination
and their senses, I will answer for the production of finer historical
and scripture-pieces in this country (let us be as far north as we will)
than we have yet seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—You do not think, then, that we are naturally a dry, sour,
Protestant set? Is not the air of Ireland Popish, and that of
Scotland Presbyterian?</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—No: though you may have it so if you please. K— has
been wanting my two copies of —, though I do not think he will
bid high enough to induce me to part with them. I am in this respect
like Opie, who had an original by Sir Joshua that he much valued,
and he used to say, ‘I don’t know what I should do in that case, but
I hope to G—d nobody will offer me 500<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> for it!’ It is curious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>this very picture sold for 500l. the other day. So it is that real
merit creeps on, and is sure to find its level. The ‘Holy Family’
sold among Lord Gwydir’s pictures for 1,900<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i></p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Is that fine?</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Oh yes! it’s certainly fine. It wants the air of history,
but it has a rich colour and great simplicity and innocence. It is
not equal to the ‘Snake in the Grass,’ which Mr. Peel gave
1,600 guineas for. That was his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i>: nothing is wanting
there.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>A Stranger.</em>—I thought Sir Joshua’s colours did not stand?</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—That is true of some of them: he tried experiments, and had
no knowledge of chemistry, and bought colours of Jews: but I speak
of them as they came from the easel. As he left them and intended
them to be, no pictures in the world would stand by the side of them.
Colour seemed to exist substantively in his mind. You see this still
in those that have not faded—in his latter works especially, which
were also his best; and this, with character and a certain sweetness,
must always make his works invaluable. You come to this at last—what
you find in any one that you can get nowhere else. If you
have this about you, you need not be afraid of time. Gainsborough
had the saving grace of originality; and you cannot put him down for
that reason. With all their faults, and the evident want of an early
study and knowledge of the art, his pictures fetch more every time
they are brought to the hammer. I don’t know what it was that his
‘View of the Mall in St. James’s Park’ sold for not long ago. I
remember Mr. P. H. coming to me, and saying what an exquisite
picture Gainsborough had painted of the Park. You would suppose
it would be stiff and formal with the straight rows of trees and people
sitting on benches—it is all in motion, and in a flutter like a lady’s
fan. Watteau is not half so airy. His picture of young lord —
was a masterpiece—there was such a look of natural gentility. You
must recollect his ‘Girl feeding pigs:’ the expression and truth of
nature were never surpassed. Sir Joshua was struck with it, though
he said he ought to have made her a beauty.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Perhaps it was as well to make sure of one thing at a time.
I remember being once driven by a shower of rain for shelter into a
picture dealer’s shop in Oxford-street, where there stood on the floor
a copy of Gainsborough’s ‘Shepherd-boy’ with the thunder-storm
coming on. What a truth and beauty was there! He stands with
his hands clasped, looking up with a mixture of timidity and resignation,
eying a magpie chattering over his head, while the wind is
rustling in the branches. It was like a vision breathed on the canvas.
I have been fond of Gainsborough ever since.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>N.—Oh! that was an essence: but it was only a copy you saw?
The picture was finer than his ‘Woodman,’ which has a little false
glitter and attempt at theatrical effect; but the other is innocence
itself. Gainsborough was a natural gentleman; and with all his
simplicity he had wit too. An eminent counsellor once attempted to
puzzle him on some trial about the originality of a picture by saying,
‘I observe you lay great stress on the phrase, the <em>painter’s eye</em>; what
do you mean by that?’ ‘The painter’s eye,’ answered Gainsborough,
‘is to him what the lawyer’s tongue is to you.’ Sir Joshua was not
fond of Wilson, and said at one of the Academy dinners, ‘Yes,
Gainsborough is certainly the best landscape-painter of the day.’
‘No,’ replied Wilson, who overheard him, ‘but he is the best
portrait-painter.’ This was a sufficient testimony in Gainsborough’s
favour.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—He did not make himself agreeable at Buckingham-house,
any more than Sir Joshua, who kept a certain distance and wished to
appear as a gentleman; they wanted a <em>buffoon</em> whom they might be
familiar with at first, and insult the moment he overstepped the mark,
or as soon as they grew tired of him. Their favourites must be like
<em>pet</em> lap-dogs or monkeys.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—C— went to court the other day after a long absence. He
was very graciously received, notwithstanding. The K— held
out his hand for him to kiss; he recollected himself in time to
perceive the object. He was struck with the manner in which the
great people looked towards the King, and the utter insignificance of
every thing else; ‘and then,’ said C—, ‘as soon as they are out
of the palace, they get into their carriages, and ride over you with all
the fierceness and insolence imaginable.’ West used to say you could
tell the highest nobility at court by their being the most abject. This
was policy, for the most powerful would be most apt to excite jealousy
in the sovereign; and by showing an extreme respect, they thought to
prevent the possibility of encroachment or insult. Garrick complained
that when he went to read before the court, not a look or a murmur
testified approbation; there was a profound stillness—every one only
watched to see what the King thought. It was like reading to a set
of wax-work figures: he who had been accustomed to the applause
of thousands, could not bear this assembly of mutes. Marchant went
to the late King about a cameo, who was offended at his saying the
face must be done in full and not as a profile; ‘then,’ said the patron,
‘I’ll get somebody else to do it.’ Coming out at the door, one of
the pages asked the artist, ‘Why do you contradict the K—?
He is not used to be contradicted!’ This is intelligible in an
absolute despotism, where the will of the sovereign is law, and where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>he can cut off your head if he pleases; but is it not strange in a free
country?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—It is placing an ordinary mortal on the top of a pyramid,
and kneeling at the bottom of it to the ‘highest and mightiest.’
It is a trick of human reason surpassing the grossness of the brute.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE NINETEENTH</h4>

<p class='c009'>H.—Fashion is gentility running away from vulgarity, and afraid
of being overtaken by it. It is a sign the two things are not very far
asunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Yes; Mr. — used to say, that just before the women in
his time left off hoops, they looked like bats. Going on from one
affectation to another, they at last wore them close under their arms,
so that they resembled wings growing out from their shoulders; and
having reached the top of the absurdity, they then threw them aside
all at once. If long waists are the fashion one season, they are
exploded the next; as soon as the court adopts any particular mode,
the city follows the example, and as soon as the city takes it up, the
court lays it down. The whole is caricature and masquerade. <em>Nature
only is left out</em>; for that is either common, or what is fine in it would
not always be found on the fashionable side of the question. It may
be the fashion to paint or not to paint; but if it were the fashion to
have a fine complexion, many fashionable people must go without one,
and many unfashionable ones would be at the height of it. Deformity
is as often the fashion as beauty, yet the world in general see no other
beauty than fashion, and their vanity or interest or complaisance
bribes their understanding to disbelieve even their senses. If cleanliness
is the fashion, then cleanliness is admired; if dirt, hair-powder,
and pomatum are the fashion, then dirt, hair-powder, and pomatum
are admired just as much, if not more, from their being disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—The secret is, that fashion is imitating in certain things that
are in our power and that are nearly indifferent in themselves, those
who possess certain other advantages that are not in our power, and
which the possessors are as little disposed to part with as they are
eager to obtrude them upon the notice of others by every external
symbol at their immediate controul. We think the cut of a coat
fine, because it is worn by a man with ten thousand a-year, with a fine
house, and a fine carriage: as we cannot get the ten thousand a-year,
the house, or the carriage, we get what we can—the cut of the fine
gentleman’s coat, and thus are in the fashion. But as we get it, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>gets rid of it, which shows that he cares nothing about it; but he
keeps his ten thousand a-year, his fine house, and his fine carriage.
A rich man wears gold-buckles to show that he is rich: a coxcomb
gets gilt ones to look like the rich man, and as soon as the gold ones
prove nothing, the rich man leaves them off. So it is with all the
real advantages that fashionable people possess. Say that they have
more grace, good manners, and refinement than the rabble; but these
do not change every moment at the nod of fashion. Speaking correctly
is not proper to one class more than another: if the fashionable,
to distinguish themselves from the vulgar, affect a peculiar tone
or set of phrases, this is mere <em>slang</em>. The difference between grace
and awkwardness is the same one year after another. This is the
meaning of <em>natural politeness</em>. It is a perception of and attention to
the feelings of others, which is the same thing, whether it is neglected
by the Great or practised by the vulgar. The barrier between
refinement and grossness cannot be arbitrarily effaced. Nothing
changes but what depends on the shallow affectation and assumption
of superiority: real excellence can never become vulgar. So Pope
says in his elegant way—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Virtue may choose the high or low degree,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis just the same to virtue and to me;</div>
      <div class='line'>Dwell in a monk or light upon a king,</div>
      <div class='line'>She’s still the same belov’d, contented thing.</div>
      <div class='line'>Vice is undone if she forgets her birth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And stoops from angels to the dregs of earth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Pope’s verse is not admired, because it was once the fashion: it
will be admired, let the fashion change how it will.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—When Sir Joshua Reynolds wanted to learn what real grace
was, he studied it in the attitudes of children, not in the school of
the dancing-master, or in the empty strut or mawkish languor of
fashion. A young painter asked me the other day whether I thought
that Guido was not chargeable with affectation? I told him that I
thought <em>not</em>, or in a very trifling degree. I could not deny that
Guido sometimes bordered on and reminded me of it; or that there
was that which in any body else might be really so, but that in him
it seemed only an extreme natural gentility. He puts his figures into
attitudes that are a little too courtly and studied, but he probably
could not help it.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—It was rather the excess of a quality or feeling in his mind,
than the aiming to supply the defect of one.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Yes; there is no suspicion of what he is doing. The odious
part of affectation is when there is an evident design to impose on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>you with counterfeit pretensions. So in another point that might be
objected to him, the impropriety of his naked figures, no mortal can
steer clearer of it than he does. They may be strictly said to be
clothed with their own delicacy and beauty. There is the ‘Venus
attired by the Graces:’ what other painter durst attempt it? They
are to be all beauties, all naked; yet he has escaped as if by miracle—none
but the most vicious can find fault with it—the very beauty,
elegance, and grace keep down instead of exciting improper ideas.
And then again, the ‘Andromeda chained to the rock’—both are,
I believe, in the drawing-room at Windsor: but there is no possible
offence to be taken at them, nothing to shock the most timid or
innocent, because there was no particle of grossness in the painter’s
mind. I have seen pictures by others muffled up to the chin, that
had twenty times as much vice in them. It is wonderful how the
cause is seen in the effect. So we find it in Richardson. <cite>Clarissa</cite>
is a story in the midst of temptation; but he comes clear and
triumphant out of that ordeal, because his own imagination is not
contaminated by it. If there had been the least hint of an immoral
tendency, the slightest indication of a wish to inflame the passions,
it would have been all over with him. The intention always will
peep out—you do not communicate a disease if you are not infected
with it yourself. Albano’s nymphs and goddesses seem waiting for
admirers: Guido’s are protected with a veil of innocence and
modesty. Titian would have given them an air of Venetian
courtesans: Raphael would have made them look something more
than mortal: neither would have done what Guido has effected,
who has conquered the difficulty by the pure force of feminine
softness and delicacy.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I am glad to hear you speak so of Guido. I was beginning,
before I went abroad, to have a ‘sneaking contempt’ for him as
insipid and monotonous, from seeing the same everlasting repetitions
of Cleopatras and Madonnas: but I returned a convert to his merits.
I saw many indifferent pictures attributed to great masters; but
wherever I saw a Guido, I found elegance and beauty that answered
to the ‘silver’ sound of his name. The mind lives on a round of
names; and it is a great point gained not to have one of these
snatched from us by a sight of their works. As to the display of
the naked figure in works of art, the case to me seems clear: it is
only when there is nothing but the naked figure that it is offensive.
In proportion as the beauty or perfection of the imitation rises, the
indecency vanishes. You look at it then with an eye to art, just
as the anatomist examines the human figure with a view to science.
Other ideas are introduced. J. —, of Edinburgh, had a large,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>sprawling Danae hanging over the chimney-piece of his office, where
he received Scotch parsons and their wives on law-business: he
thought it a triumph over Presbyterian prudery and prejudice, and
a sort of chivalrous answer to the imputed barbarism of the North.
It was certainly a paradox in taste, a breach of manners. He asked
me if I objected to it because it was naked? ‘No,’ I said, ‘but
because it is ugly: you can only have put it there because it is
naked, and that alone shows a felonious intent. Had there been
either beauty or expression, it would have <em>conducted off</em> the objectionable
part. As it is, I don’t see how you can answer it to the
kirk-sessions.’</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I remember Sir W. W— employed Sir Joshua and
Dance, who was a very eminent designer, to ornament a music-room
which he had built. Sir Joshua on this occasion painted his St.
Cecilia, which he made very fine at first, but afterwards spoiled it;
and Dance chose the subject of Orpheus. When I asked Miss
Reynolds what she thought of it, she said she had no doubt of its
being clever and well done, but that it looked ‘like a naked man.’
This answer was conclusive against it; for if the inspiration of the
character had been given, you would have overlooked the want of
clothes. The nakedness only strikes and offends the eye in the
barrenness of other matter. It is the same in the drama. Mere
grossness or ribaldry is intolerable; but you often find in the old
comedy that the wit and ingenuity (as well as custom) carry off what
otherwise could not be borne. The laughter prevents the blush. So
an expression seems gross in one person’s mouth, which in another
passes off with perfect innocence. The reason is, there is something
in the manner that gives a quite different construction to what is said.
Have you seen the <cite>Alcides</cite>, the two foreigners who perform such
prodigious feats of strength at the theatre, but with very little clothing
on? They say the people hardly know what to make of it. They
should not be too sure that this is any proof of their taste or virtue.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I recollect a remark of Coleridge’s on the conclusion of the
story of <cite>Paul and Virginia</cite> by Bernardin St. Pierre. Just before the
shipwreck, and when nothing else can save the heroine from perishing,
an athletic figure comes forward stripped, but with perfect respect,
and offers to swim with her to the shore; but instead of accepting his
proposal, she turns away with affected alarm. This, Coleridge said,
was a proof of the prevailing tone of French depravity, and not of
virgin innocence. A really modest girl in such circumstances would
not have thought of any scruple.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—It is the want of imagination or of an insight into nature in
ordinary writers; they do not know how to place themselves in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>situations they describe. Whatever feeling or passion is uppermost,
fills the mind and drives out every other. If you were confined in a
vault, and thought you saw a ghost, you would rush out, though a
lion was at the entrance. On the other hand, if you were pursued by
a lion, you would take refuge in a charnel-house, though it was full of
spirits, and would disregard the dead bones and putrid relics about
you. Both passions may be equally strong; the question is, which
is roused first. But it is few who can get to the fountain-head, the
secret springs of Nature. Shakspeare did it always; and Sir Walter
Scott frequently. G— says he always was pleased with my conversation,
before you broached that opinion; but I do not see how
that can be, for he always contradicts and thwarts me. When two
people are constantly crossing one another on the road, they cannot
be very good company. You agree to what I say, and often explain
or add to it, which encourages me to go on.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I believe G— is sincere in what he says, for he has
frequently expressed the same opinion to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—That might be so, though he took great care not to let me
know it. People would often more willingly speak well of you
behind your back than to your face; they are afraid either of shocking
your modesty or gratifying your vanity. That was the case with —.
If he ever was struck with any thing I did, he made a point not to
let me see it: he treated it lightly, and said it was very well.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I do not think G—’s differing with you was any proof of
his opinion. Like most authors, he has something of the schoolmaster
about him, and wishes to keep up an air of authority. What you say
may be very well for a learner; but he is the oracle. You must not
set up for yourself; and to keep you in due subordination, he
catechises and contradicts from mere habit.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Human nature is always the same. It was so with Johnson
and Goldsmith. They would allow no one to have any merit but
themselves. The very attempt was a piece of presumption, and a
trespass upon their privileged rights. I remember a poem that came
out, and that was sent to Sir Joshua: his servant, Ralph, had
instructions to bring it in just after dinner. Goldsmith presently got
hold of it, and seemed thrown into a rage before he had read a line
of it. He then said, ‘What wretched stuff is here! what c—rsed
nonsense that is!’ and kept all the while marking the passages with
his thumb-nail, as if he would cut them in pieces. At last, Sir
Joshua, who was provoked, interfered, and said, ‘Nay, don’t spoil my
book, however.’ Dr. Johnson looked down on the rest of the world
as pigmies; he smiled at the very idea that any one should set up for
a fine writer but himself. They never admitted C— as one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>set; Sir Joshua did not invite him to dinner. If he had been in the
room, Goldsmith would have flown out of it as if a dragon had been
there. I remember Garrick once saying, ‘D—n his <em>dishclout</em> face;
his plays would never do if it were not for my patching them up and
acting in them.’ Another time, he took a poem of C—’s, and
read it backwards to turn it into ridicule. Yet some of his pieces
keep possession of the stage, so that there must be something in them.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Perhaps he was later than they, and they considered him as
an interloper on that account.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—No; there was a prejudice against him: he did not somehow
fall into the train. It was the same with Vanbrugh in Pope’s time.
They made a jest of him, and endeavoured to annoy him in every
possible way; he was a <em>black sheep</em> for no reason in the world, except
that he was cleverer than they; that is, could build houses and write
verses at the same time. They laughed at his architecture; yet it is
certain that it is quite original, and at least a question whether it is
not beautiful as well as new. He was the first who sunk the window-frames
within the walls of houses—they projected before: he did it
as a beauty, but it has been since adopted by act of parliament to
prevent fire. Some gentleman was asking me about the imposing
style of architecture with which Vanbrugh had decorated the top of
Blenheim-house; he had mistaken the chimneys for an order of
architecture, so that what is an eye-sore in all other buildings,
Vanbrugh has had the art to convert into an ornament. And then
his wit! Think what a comedy is the <cite>Provoked Husband</cite>! What
a scope and comprehension in the display of manners from the highest
to the lowest! It was easier to write an epigram on <cite>Brother Van</cite>
than such a play as this. I once asked Richards, the scene-painter,
who was perfectly used to the stage, and acquainted with all the
actors, what he considered as the best play in the language? And he
answered, without hesitation, <cite>The Journey to London</cite>.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—<cite>Lord Foppington</cite> is also his, if he wanted <em>supporters</em>. He was
in the same situation as Rousseau with respect to the wits of his time,
who traces all his misfortunes and the jealousy that pursued him
through life to the success of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Devin du Village</span></cite>. He said Diderot
and the rest could have forgiven his popularity as an author, but they
could not bear his writing an opera.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—If you belong to a set, you must either lead or follow; you
cannot maintain your independence. Beattie did very well with the
great folks in my time, because he looked up to them, and he excited
no uneasy sense of competition. Indeed, he managed so well that
Sir Joshua flattered him and his book in return in the most effectual
manner. In his allegorical portrait of the doctor, he introduced the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>angel of truth chasing away the demons of falsehood and impiety,
who bore an obvious resemblance to Hume and Voltaire. This
brought out Goldsmith’s fine reproof of his friend, who said that ‘Sir
Joshua might be ashamed of debasing a genius like Voltaire before a
man like Beattie, whose works would be forgotten in a few years,
while Voltaire’s fame would last for ever!’ Sir J. R. took the
design of this picture from one of a similar subject by Tintoret, now
in the Royal Collection in Kensington Palace. He said he had no
intention of the sort: Hume was a broad-backed clumsy figure, not
very like; but I know he meant Voltaire, for I saw a French medal
of him lying about in the room. Mrs. Beattie also came up with her
husband to London. I recollect her asking for ‘a little <em>paurter</em>’ in
her broad Scotch way. It is like Cibber’s seeing Queen Anne at
Nottingham when he was a boy, and all he could remember about her
was her asking him to give her ‘a glass of wine and water.’ She
was an ordinary character, and belonged to the class of good sort of
people. So the Margravine of Bareuth describes the Duchess of
Kendal, who was mistress to George I. to be a quiet inoffensive
character, who would do neither good nor harm to any body. Did
you ever read her <cite>Memoirs</cite>? Lord! what an account she gives of
the state of manners at the old court of Prussia, and of the brutal
despotism and cruelty of the king! She was his daughter, and he
used to strike her, and drag her by the hair of her head, and leave
her with her face bleeding, and often senseless, on the floor for the
smallest trifles; and he treated her brother, afterwards Frederic II.
(and to whom she was much attached) no better. That might in part
account for the hardness of his character at a later period.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I suppose Prussia was at that time a mere petty state or sort
of bye-court, so that what they did was pretty much done in a corner,
and they were not afraid of being talked of by the rest of Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—No; it was quite an absolute monarchy with all the pomp
and pretensions of sovereignty. Frederick (the father) was going, on
some occasion when he was displeased with him, to strike our
ambassador; but this conduct was resented and put a stop to. The
Queen (sister to George <span class='fss'>II.</span> and who was imprisoned so long on a
suspicion of conjugal infidelity) appears to have been a violent-spirited
woman, and also weak. George <span class='fss'>I.</span> could never learn to speak
English, and his successor, George <span class='fss'>II.</span>, spoke it badly, and neither
ever felt themselves at home in this country; and they were always
going over to Hanover, where they found themselves lords and
masters, while here, though they had been raised so much higher,
their dignity never sat easy upon them. They did not know what to
make of their new situation.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘We have had a terrible succession of stormy weather of late.
Tuesday, immediately after dinner, I went to the Hoe to see the
Dutton East Indiaman, full of troops, upon the rocks, directly under
the flag-staff of the citadel. She had been out seven weeks on her
passage to the West Indies as a transport, with 400 troops on board,
besides women and the ship’s-crew; and had been just driven back by
distress of weather, with a great number of sick on board. You
cannot conceive any thing so horrible as the appearance of things
altogether, which I beheld when I first arrived on the spot. The
ship was stuck on sunken rocks, somewhat inclining to one side, and
without a mast or the bowsprit standing; and her decks covered
with the soldiers as thick as they could possibly stand by one another,
with the sea breaking in a most horrible manner all around them;
and what still added to the melancholy grandeur of the scene was the
distress-guns which were fired now and then directly over our head
from the Citadel.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘When I first came to the spot, I found that they had by some
means got a rope with one end of it fixed to the ship, and the other
was held by the people on shore, by which means they could yield as
the ship swung. Upon this rope they had got a ring, which they
could by means of two smaller ropes draw forwards and backwards
from the ship to the shore: to this ring they had fixed a loop, which
each man put under his arm; and by this means, and holding by the
ring with his hands, he supported himself, hanging to the ring, while
he was drawn to the shore by the people there; and in this manner
I saw a great many drawn on shore. But this proved a tedious
work; and though I looked at them for a long time, yet the numbers
on the deck were not apparently diminished; besides, from the motion
which the ship had by rolling on the rocks, it was not possible to keep
the rope equally stretched, and from this cause, as well as from the
sudden rising of the waves, you would at one moment see a poor wretch
hanging ten or twenty feet above the water, and the next you would
lose sight of him in the foam of a wave, though some escaped better.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘But this was not a scheme which the women and many of the
sick could avail themselves of.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘I observed with some admiration the behaviour of a Captain of a
man-of-war, who seemed interested in the highest degree for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>safety of these poor wretches. He exerted himself uncommonly,
and directed others what to do on shore, and endeavoured in vain
with a large speaking-trumpet to make himself heard by those on
board: but finding that nothing could be heard but the roaring of the
wind and sea, he offered any body five guineas instantly who would
suffer himself to be drawn on board with instructions to them what to
do. And when he found that nobody would accept his offer, he
gave an instance of the highest heroism: for he fixed the rope about
himself and gave the signal to be drawn on board. He had his
uniform coat on and his sword hanging at his side. I have not room
to describe the particulars; but there was something grand and
interesting in the thing: for as soon as they had pulled him into the
wreck, he was received with three vast shouts by the people on
board; and these were immediately echoed by those who lined the
shore, the garrison-walls and lower batteries. The first thing he did
was to rig out two other ropes like the first: which I saw him most
active in doing with his own hands. This quickened the matter a
good deal, and by this time two large open row-boats were arrived
from the Dock-yard, and a sloop had with difficulty worked out from
Plymouth-pool. He then became active in getting out the women
and the sick, who were with difficulty got into the open boats, and
by them carried off to the sloop, which kept off for fear of being
stove against the ship or thrown upon the rocks. He suffered but
one boat to approach the ship at a time, and stood with his drawn
sword to prevent too many rushing into the boat. After he had seen
all the people out of the ship to about ten or fifteen, he fixed himself
to the rope as before and was drawn ashore, where he was again
received with shouts. Upon my enquiry who this gallant officer was,
I was informed that it was Sir Edward Pellew, whom I had heard
the highest character of before, both for bravery and mercy.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘The soldiers were falling into disorder when Sir Edward went
on board. Many of them were drunk, having broke into the cabin
and got at the liquor. I saw him beating one with the flat of his
broad-sword, in order to make him give up a bundle he had made up
of plunder. They had but just time to save the men, before the ship
was nearly under water. I observed a poor goat and a dog amongst
the crowd, when the people were somewhat thinned away. I saw
the goat marching about with much unconcern; but the dog showed
evident anxiety, for I saw him stretching himself out at one of the
port-holes, standing partly upon the port and partly upon a gun, and
looking earnestly towards the shore, where I suppose he knew his
master was. All these perished soon after, as the ship was washed
all over as the sea rose—she is now in pieces.’</p>

  <h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE TWENTIETH</h4>
</div>

<p class='c009'>N.—Have you seen the <cite>Life of Sir Joshua</cite> just published?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—No.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—It is all, or nearly all, taken from my account, and yet the
author misrepresents or contradicts every thing I say, I suppose to
show that he is under no obligation to me. I cannot understand the
drift of his work; nor who it is he means to please. He finds fault
with Sir Joshua, among a number of other things, for not noticing
Hogarth. Why, it was not his business to notice Hogarth any more
than it was to notice Fielding. Both of them were great wits and
describers of manners in common life, but neither of them came
under the article of painting. What Hogarth had was his own, and
nobody will ever have it again in the same degree. But all that did
not depend on his own genius was detestable, both as to his subjects
and his execution. Was Sir Joshua to recommend these as models
to the student? No, we are to imitate only what is best, and that
in which even failure is honourable; not that where only originality
and the highest point of success can at all excuse the attempt.
Cunningham (the writer of the <cite>Life</cite>), pretends to cry up Hogarth as
a painter; but this is not true. He moulded little figures and placed
them to see how the lights fell and how the drapery came in, which
gave a certain look of reality and relief; but this was not enough to
give breadth or grace, and his figures look like puppets after all, or
like dolls dressed up. Who would compare any of these little,
miserable, deformed caricatures of men and women, to the figure of
St. Paul preaching at Athens? What we justly admire and emulate
is that which raises human nature, not that which degrades and holds
it up to scorn. We may laugh to see a person rolled in the kennel,
but we are ashamed of ourselves for doing so. We are amused with
<cite>Tom Jones</cite>; but we rise from the perusal of <cite>Clarissa</cite> with higher
feelings and better resolutions than we had before. St. Giles’s is
not the only school of art. It is nature, to be sure; but we must
select nature. Ask the meanest person in the gallery at a play-house
which he likes best, the tragedy or the farce? And he will tell you,
without hesitation, the tragedy—and will prefer Mrs. Siddons to the
most exquisite buffoon. He feels an ambition to be placed in the
situations, and to be associated with the characters, described in
tragedy, and none to be connected with those in a farce; because he
feels a greater sense of power and dignity in contemplating the one,
and only sees his own weakness and littleness reflected and ridiculed
in the other. Even the poetry, the blank verse, pleases the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>illiterate, which it would not do if it were not natural. The world
do not receive monsters. This was what I used to contest with Sir
Joshua. He insisted that the blank verse in tragedy was purely
artificial—a thing got up for the occasion. But surely every one
must feel that he delivers an important piece of information, or asks
a common question in a different tone of voice. If it were not for
this, the audience would laugh at the measured speech or step of
a tragic actor as burlesque, just as they are inclined to do at an
Opera. Old Mr. Tolcher used to say of the famous Pulteney—‘My
Lord Bath always speaks in blank verse!’ The stately march
of his ideas, no doubt, made it natural to him. Mr. Cunningham
will never persuade the world that Hogarth is superior to Raphael or
Reynolds. Common sense is against it. I don’t know where he
picked up the notion.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Probably from Mr. Lamb, who endeavours to set up Hogarth
as a great tragic as well as comic genius, not inferior in either respect
to Shakspeare.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I can’t tell where he got such an opinion; but I know it is
great nonsense. Cunningham gives a wrong account of an anecdote
which he has taken from me. Dr. Tucker, Dean of Gloucester,
had said at a meeting of the Society of Arts, that ‘a pin-maker was
a more important member of society than Raphael.’ Sir Joshua had
written some remark on this assertion in an old copy-book which fell
into my hands and which nobody probably ever saw but myself.
Cunningham states that Sir Joshua was present when Dean Tucker
made the speech at the Society, and that he immediately rose up,
and with great irritation answered him on the spot, which is contrary
both to the fact and to Sir Joshua’s character. He would never have
thought of rising to contradict any one in a public assembly for not
agreeing with him on the importance of his own profession. In one
part of the new <cite>Life</cite>, it is said that Sir Joshua, seeing the ill-effects
that Hogarth’s honesty and bluntness had had upon his prospects as a
portrait-painter, had learnt the art to make himself agreeable to his
sitters, and to mix up the oil of flattery with his discourse as
assiduously as with his colours. This is far from the truth. Sir
Joshua’s manners were indeed affable and obliging, but he flattered
nobody; and instead of gossiping or making it his study to amuse his
sitters, minded only his own business. I remember being in the next
room the first time the Duchess of Cumberland came to sit, and I
can vouch that scarce a word was spoken for near two hours.
Another thing remarkable to show how little Sir Joshua crouched
to the Great is, that he never even gave them their proper titles. I
never heard the words ‘<em>your lordship or your ladyship</em>,’ come from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>mouth; nor did he ever say <em>Sir</em> in speaking to any one but Dr.
Johnson: and when he did not hear distinctly what the latter said
(which often happened) he would then say ‘Sir?’ that he might
repeat it. He was in this respect like a Quaker, not from any
scruples or affectation of independence, but possibly from some
awkwardness and confusion in addressing the variety of characters he
met with, or at his first entrance on his profession. His biographer
is also unjust to Sir Joshua in stating that his table was scantily
supplied out of penuriousness. The truth is, Sir Joshua would ask a
certain number and order a dinner to be provided; and then in the
course of the morning, two or three other persons would drop in, and
he would say, ‘I have got so and so to dinner, will you join us?’
which they being always ready to do, there were sometimes more
guests than seats, but nobody complained of this or was unwilling to
come again. If Sir Joshua had really grudged his guests, they would
not have repeated their visits twice, and there would have been
plenty of room and of provisions the next time. Sir Joshua never
gave the smallest attention to such matters; all he cared about was
his painting in the morning, and the conversation at his table, to
which last he sacrificed his interest; for his associating with men like
Burke, who was at that time a great oppositionist, did him no good
at court. Sir Joshua was equally free from meanness or ostentation
and encroachment on others; no one knew himself better or more
uniformly kept his place in society.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—It is a pity to mar the idea of Sir Joshua’s dinner-parties,
which are one of the pleasantest instances on record of a cordial
intercourse between persons of distinguished pretensions of all sorts.
But some people do not care what they spoil, so that they can tell
disagreeable truth.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—In the present case there is not even that excuse. The
statement answers no good end, while it throws a very unfounded
slur on Sir Joshua’s hospitality and love of good cheer. It is insinuated
that he was sparing of his wine, which is not true. Again,
I am blamed for not approving of Dr. Johnson’s speech to Sir Joshua
at the Miss Cottrells’, when the Duchess of Argyll came in, and he
thought himself neglected—‘How much do you think you and I
could earn in a week, if we were to work as hard as we could?’
This was a rude and unmerited insult. The Miss Cottrells were the
daughters of an Admiral and people of fashion, as well as the
Duchess of Argyll; and they naturally enough fell into conversation
about persons and things that they knew, though Dr. Johnson had
not been used to hear of them. He therefore thought it affectation
and insolence, whereas the vulgarity and insolence were on his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>side. If I had any fault to find with Sir Joshua, it would be that he
was a very bad master in the art. Of all his pupils, I am the only
one who ever did any thing at all. He was like the boy teaching
the other to swim. ‘How do you do when you want to turn?’—‘How
must you do when you turn? Why, you must look that
way!’ Sir Joshua’s instructions amounted to little more. People
talk of the instinct of animals as if a <em>blind reason</em> were an absurdity:
whereas whatever men can do best, they understand and can explain
least. Your son was looking at that picture of the lap-dog the other
evening. There is a curious story about that. The dog was walking
out with me one day, and was set upon and bit by a strange dog, for
all dogs know and hate a favourite. He was a long time in recovering
from the wound; and one day when Mr. P. H. called, he ran
up to him, leaped up quite over-joyed, then lay down, began to whine,
patted the place where he had been hurt with his paws, and went
through the whole history of his misfortune. It was a perfect
pantomime. I will not tell the story to G—, for the philosopher
would be jealous of the sagacity of the cur.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—There was Jack Spines, the racket-player: he excelled in
what is called the <em>half-volley</em>. Some amateurs of the game were one
day disputing what this term of art meant. Spines was appealed to.
‘Why, gentlemen,’ says he, ‘I really can’t say exactly; but I should
think, the half-volley is something between the volley and the half-volley.’
This definition was not quite the thing. The celebrated
John Davies, the finest player in the world, could give no account
of his proficiency that way. It is a game which no one thinks of
playing without putting on a flannel jacket; and after you have been
engaged in it for ten minutes, you are just as if you had been dipped
in a mill-pond. John Davies never pulled off his coat; and merely
buttoning it that it might not be in his way, would go down into the
Fives-court and play two of the best players of the day, and at the
end of the match you could not perceive that a hair of his head was
wet. Powell, the keeper of the court (why does not Sir B. Nash,
among so many innovations, rebuild it?) said he never seemed to
follow the ball, but that it came to him—he did every thing with
such ease.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Then every motion of that man was perfect grace: there
was not a muscle in his body that did not contribute its share to the
game. So, when they begin to learn the piano-forte, at first they
use only the fingers, and are soon tired to death: then the muscles
of the arm come into play, which relieves them a little; and at last
the whole frame is called into action, so as to produce the effect
with entire ease and gracefulness. It is the same in every thing: and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>he is indeed a poor creature who cannot do more, from habit or
natural genius, than he can give any rational account of.</p>

<p class='c013'>(<em>Some remarks having been made on the foregoing conversation,
Mr. Northcote, the next time I saw him, took up the subject nearly as
follows.</em>)</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—The newspaper critic asks with an air of triumph as if he had
found <em>a mare’s nest</em>—‘What! are <cite>Sophia Western</cite> and <cite>Allworthy</cite>,
St. Giles’s?’ Why, they are the very ones: they are <cite>Tower-stamp</cite>!
<cite>Blifil</cite>, and <cite>Black George</cite>, and <cite>Square</cite> are not—they have some sense
and spirit in them and are so far redeemed, for Fielding put his own
cleverness and ingenuity into them; but as to his refined characters,
they are an essence of vulgarity and insipidity. <cite>Sophia</cite> is a poor doll;
and as to <cite>Allworthy</cite> he has not the soul of a goose: and how does he
behave to the young man that he has brought up and pampered with
the expectations of a fortune and of being a fine gentleman? Does
he not turn him out to starve or rob on the highway without the
shadow of an excuse, on a mere maudlin sermonizing pretext of
morality, and with as little generosity as principle? No, Fielding
did not know what virtue or refinement meant. As Richardson said,
he should have thought his books were written by an ostler; or
Sir John Hawkins has expressed it still better, that the virtues of his
heroes are the virtues of dogs and horses—he does not go beyond
that—nor indeed so far, for his <cite>Tom Jones</cite> is not so good as Lord
Byron’s Newfoundland dog. I have known Newfoundland dogs
with twenty times his understanding and good-nature. That is
where Richardson has the advantage over Fielding—the virtues of
<em>his</em> characters are not the virtues of animals—<cite>Clarissa</cite> holds her head
in the skies, a ‘bright particular star;’ for whatever may be said, we
have such <em>ideas</em>—and thanks to those who sustain and nourish them,
and woe to those critics who would confound them with the dirt
under our feet and Grub-street jargon! No, that is what we want—to
have the line made as black and as broad as possible that separates
what we have in common with the animals from what we <em>pretend</em> (at
least) to have above them. That is where the newspaper critic is
wrong in saying that the blackguard in the play is equal to Mrs.
Siddons. No, he is not equal to Mrs. Siddons, any more than a
baited bull or an over-drove ox is equal to Mrs. Siddons. There is
the same animal fury in <cite>Tyke</cite> that there is in the maddened brute,
with the same want of any ideas beyond himself and his own
mechanical and coarse impulses—it is the lowest stage of human
capacity and feeling violently acted upon by circumstances. <cite>Lady
Macbeth</cite>, if she is the demon, is not the brute; she has the
intellectual part, and is hurried away no less by the violence of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>will than by a wide scope of imagination and a lofty ambition.
Take away all dignity and grandeur from poetry and art, and you
make Emery equal to Mrs. Siddons, and Hogarth to Raphael, but
not else. Emery’s <cite>Tyke</cite>, in his extremity, calls for brandy—Mrs.
Siddons does not, like <cite>Queen Dollalolla</cite>, call for a glass of gin. Why
not? Gin is as natural a drink as poison; but if Capella Bianca,
instead of swallowing the poison herself, when she found it was not
given to her enemy, had merely got drunk for spite, in the manner
of Hogarth’s heroines, she would not have been recorded in history.
There is then a foundation for the distinction between the heroic and
the natural, which I am not bound to explain any more than I am to
account why black is not white.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—If Emery is equal to Mrs. Siddons, Morton is equal to
Shakspeare; though it would be difficult to bring such persons to
that conclusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I ‘ll tell you why Emery in not equal to Mrs. Siddons; there
are a thousand Emerys to one Mrs. Siddons; the stage is always full
of six or seven comic actors at a time, so that you cannot tell which
is best, Emery, Fawcett, Munden, Lewis—but in my time I have
seen but Garrick and Mrs. Siddons, who have left a gap behind
them that I shall not live to see filled up. Emery is the first blackguard
or stage-coach driver you see in a <em>row</em> in the street; but if you
had not seen Mrs. Siddons, you could have no idea of her; nor can
you convey it to any one who has not. She was like a preternatural
being descended to the earth. I cannot say Sir Joshua has done her
justice. I regret Mrs. Abington too—she was the Grosvenor-Square
of comedy, if you please. I am glad that Hogarth did not
paint her; it would have been a thing to spit upon. If the correspondent
of the newspaper wants to know where my Grosvenor-Square
of art is, he’ll find it in the <cite>Provoked Husband</cite>, in <cite>Lord</cite> and
<cite>Lady Townly</cite>, not in the <cite>History of a Foundling</cite>, or in the pompous,
swag-bellied peer, with his dangling pedigree, or his gawky son-in-law,
or his dawdling <em>malkin</em> of a wife from the city, playing with the
ring like an idiot, in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marriage à la Mode</span></cite>! There may be vice
and folly enough in Vanbrugh’s scenes; but it is not the vice of
St. Giles’s, it does not savour of the kennel. Not that I would have
my interrogator suppose that I think all is vice in St. Giles’s. On
the contrary, I could find at this moment instances of more virtue,
refinement, sense, and beauty there, than there are in his <cite>Sophy</cite>. No,
nature is the same everywhere; there are as many handsome children
born in St. Giles’s as in Grosvener-Square; but the same care is
not taken of them; and in general they grow up greater beauties in
the one than the other. A child in St. Giles’s is left to run wild;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>it thrusts its fingers into its mouth or pulls its nose about; but if a
child of people of fashion play any tricks of this kind, it is told
immediately, ‘You must not do this, unless you would have your
mouth reach from ear to ear; you must not say that; you must not sit
in such a manner, or you’ll grow double.’ This seems like art;
but it is only giving nature fair play. No one was allowed to touch
the Princess Charlotte when a child. She was taken care of like
something precious. The sister of the Duke of — had her
nose broke when a child in a quarrel with her sister, who flung a tea-basin
at her; but all the doctors were immediately called in, and
every remedy was applied, so that when she grew up, there was no
appearance of the accident left. If the same thing had happened to
a poor child, she would have carried the marks of it to her
grave. So you see a number of crooked people and twisted legs
among the lower classes. This was what made Lord Byron so mad—that
he had mis-shapen feet. Don’t you think so?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Yes; T. M. told a person I know that that was the cause
of all his misanthropy—he wanted to be an <cite>Adonis</cite>, and could not.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Aye, and of his genius too; it made him write verses in revenge.
There is no knowing the effect of such sort of things, of defects we wish
to balance. Do you suppose we owe nothing to Pope’s deformity? He
said to himself, ‘If my person be crooked, my verses shall be strait.’ I
myself have felt this in passing along the street, when I have heard rude
remarks made on my personal appearance. I then go home and
paint: but I should not do this, if I thought all that there is in art
was contained in Hogarth—I should then feel neither pride nor
consolation in it. But if I thought, instead of his doll-like figures
cut in two with their insipid, dough-baked faces, I should do something
like Sir Joshua’s <cite>Iphigene</cite>, with all that delights the sense in
richness of colour and luxuriance of form; or instead of the women
spouting the liquor in one another’s faces, in the <cite>Rake’s Progress</cite>, I
could give the purity, and grace, and real elegance (appearing under
all the incumbrance of the fashionable dresses of the day) of Lady
Sarah Bunbury or of the Miss Hornecks, sacrificing to the Graces,
or of Lady Essex, with her long waist and ruffles, but looking a
pattern of the female character in all its relations, and breathing
dignity and virtue, then I should think this an object worth living
for; or (as you have expressed it very properly) should even be
proud of having failed. This is the opinion the world have always
entertained of the matter. Sir Joshua’s name is repeated with more
respect than Hogarth’s. It is not for his talents, but for his taste
and the direction of them. In meeting Sir Joshua (merely from a
knowledge of his works) you would expect to meet a gentleman—not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>so of Hogarth. And yet Sir Joshua’s claims and possessions in art
were not of the highest order.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—But he was decent, and did not profess the arts and accomplishments
of a Merry-Andrew.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I assure you, it was not for want for [of] ability either. When
he was young, he did a number of caricatures of different persons,
and could have got any price for them. But he found it necessary
to give up the practice. Leonardo da Vinci, a mighty man, and
who had titles manifold, had a great turn for drawing laughable and
grotesque likenesses of his acquaintances; but he threw them all in
the fire. It was to him a kind of profanation of the art. Sir Joshua
would almost as soon have forged as he would have set his name to
a caricature. Gilray (whom you speak of) was eminent in this way;
but he had other talents as well. In the <cite>Embassy to China</cite>, he has
drawn the Emperor of China a complete Eastern voluptuary, fat and
supine, with all the effects of climate and situation evident upon his
person, and Lord Macartney is an elegant youth, a real <em>Apollo</em>; then,
indeed, come Punch and the puppet-show after him, to throw the
whole into ridicule. In the <cite>Revolutionists’ Jolly-boat</cite>, after the
Opposition were defeated, he has placed Fox, and Sheridan, and the
rest escaping from the wreck: Dante could not have described them
as looking more sullen and gloomy. He was a great man in his
way. Why does not Mr. Lamb write an essay on the <cite>Two-penny
Whist</cite>? Yet it was against his conscience, for he had been on the
other side, and was bought over. The minister sent to ask him to
do <em>them</em> half a dozen at a certain price, which he agreed to, and took
them to the treasury; but there being some demur about the payment,
he took them back with some saucy reply. He had not been
long at home, before a messenger was sent after him with the money.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE TWENTY-FIRST</h4>

<p class='c009'>N.—G. and I had a dispute lately about the capacity of animals.
He appeared to consider them as little better than machines. He
made it the distinguishing mark of superiority in man that he is the
only animal that can transmit his thoughts to future generations.
‘Yes,’ I said, ‘for future generations to take no sort of notice of them.’
I allowed that there were a few extraordinary geniuses that every one
must look up to—and I mentioned the names of Shakspeare and
Dryden. But he would not hear of Dryden, and began to pull him
in pieces immediately. ‘Why then,’ I answered, ‘if you cannot
agree among yourselves even with respect to four or five of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>eminent, how can there be the vast and overwhelming superiority
you pretend to?’ I observed that instinct in animals answered very
much to what we call genius. I spoke of the wonderful powers of
smell, and the sagacity of dogs, and the memory shown by horses in
finding a road that they have once travelled; but I made no way
with G—; he still went back to <cite>Lear</cite> and <cite>Othello</cite>.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I think he was so far right; for as this is what he understands
best and has to imitate, it is fit he should admire and dwell
upon it most. He cannot acquire the smell of the dog or the
sagacity of the horse, and therefore it is of no use to think about
them; but he may, by dint of study and emulation, become a better
poet or philosopher. The question is not merely what is best in
itself (of that we are hardly judges) but what sort of excellence we
understand best and can make our own; for otherwise, in affecting
to admire we know not what, we may admire a nonentity or a
deformity. Abraham Tucker has remarked very well on this subject,
that a swine wallowing in the mire may, for what he can tell, be as
happy as a philosopher in writing an essay, but that is no reason why
he (the philosopher) should exchange occupations or tastes with the
brute, unless he could first exchange <em>natures</em>. We may suspend our
judgments in such cases as a matter of speculation or conjecture,
but that is different from the habitual or practical feeling. So I
remember W— being nettled at D— (who affected a fashionable
taste) for saying, on coming out of the Marquis of Stafford’s gallery,
‘A very noble art, very superior to poetry!’ If it were so, W—
observed, he could know nothing about it, who had never seen any
fine pictures before. It was like an European adventurer saying to
an African chieftain, ‘A very fine boy, Sir, your black son—very
superior to my white one!’ This is mere affectation; we might as
well pretend to be thrown into rapture by a poem written in a
language we are not acquainted with. We may notwithstanding
believe that it is very fine, and have no wish to hang up the writer,
because he is not an Englishman. A spider may be a greater
mechanic than Watt or Arkwright; but the effects are not brought
home to us in the same manner, and we cannot help estimating the
cause by the effect. A friend of mine teazes me with questions,
‘Which was the greatest man, Sir Isaac Newton or a first-rate chess-player?’
It refers itself to the head of the <cite>Illustrious Obscure</cite>. A
club of chess-players might give it in favour of the <cite>Great Unknown</cite>;
but all the rest of the world, who have heard of the one and not
of the other, will give it against him. We cannot set aside those
prejudices which are founded on the limitation of our faculties or the
constitution of society; only that we need not lay them down as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>abstract or demonstrable truths. It is there the bigotry and error
begin. The language of taste and moderation is, <em>I prefer this, because
it is best to me</em>; the language of dogmatism and intolerance is, <em>Because
I prefer it, it is best in itself, and I will allow no one else to be of a
different opinion</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I find in the last conversation I saw, you make me an admirer
of Fielding, and so I am; but I find great fault with him too. I
grant he is one of those writers that I remember; he stamps his
characters, whether good or bad, on the reader’s mind. This is
more than I can say of every one. For instance, when G—
plagues me about my not having sufficient admiration of W—’s
poetry, the answer I give is, that it is not my fault, for I have
utterly forgotten it; it seemed to me like the ravelings of poetry.
But to say nothing of Fielding’s immorality, and his fancying himself
a fine gentleman in the midst of all his coarseness, he has oftener
described <em>habits</em> than <em>character</em>. For example, <em>Western</em> is no
character; it is merely the language, manners, and pursuits of the
country-squire of that day; and the proof of this is, that there is no
‘<em>Squire Western</em> now. Manners and customs wear out, but characters
last forever. I remember making this remark to Holcroft, and he
asked me, What was the difference? Are you not surprised at that?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Not in him. If you mentioned the word <em>character</em>, he
stopped you short by saying, that it was merely the difference of
circumstances; or if you hinted at the difference of natural capacity,
he said, ‘Then, Sir, you must believe in <em>innate ideas</em>.’ He surrendered
his own feelings and better judgment to a set of cant-phrases,
called the <em>modern philosophy</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I need not explain the difference to you. Character is the
ground-work, the natural <em>stamina</em> of the mind, on which circumstances
only act. You see it in St. Giles’s—there are characters there that
in the midst of filth, and vice, and ignorance, retain some traces of
their original goodness, and struggle with their situation to the last:
as in St. James’s, you will find wretches that would disgrace a
halter. <cite>Gil Blas</cite> has character.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I thought he only gave professions and classes, players, footmen,
sharpers, courtesans, but not the individual, as Fielding often
does, though we should strip <em>Western</em> of his scarlet hunting-dress and
jockey phrases. There is <em>Square</em>, <em>Blifil</em>, <em>Black George</em>, <em>Mrs. Fitzpatrick</em>,
<em>Parson Adams</em>; and a still greater cluster of them in the one
that is least read, the noble peer, the lodging-house-keeper, <em>Mrs.
Bennet</em>, and <em>Colonel Bath</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—You mean <cite>Amelia</cite>. I have not read that, but will get it. I
allow in part what you say; but in the best there is something too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>local and belonging to the time. But what I chiefly object to in
Fielding is his conceit, his consciousness of what he is doing, his
everlasting recommendation and puffing of his own wit and sagacity.
His introductory chapters make me sick.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Why, perhaps, Fielding is to be excused as a disappointed
man. All his success was late in life, for he died in 1754; and
<cite>Joseph Andrews</cite> (the first work of his that was popular) was published
in 1748. All the rest of his life he had been drudging for the
booksellers, or bringing out unsuccessful comedies. He probably
anticipated the same result in his novels, and wished to bespeak the
favour of the reader by putting himself too much forward. His
prefaces are like Ben Jonson’s prologues, and from the same cause,
mortified vanity; though it seems odd to say so at present, after the
run his writings have had; but he could not foresee that, and only
lived a short time to witness it.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I can bear any thing but that conscious look—it is to me like
the lump of soot in the broth, that spoils the whole mess. Fielding
was one of the swaggerers.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—But he had much to boast of.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—He certainly was not idle in his time. Idleness would have
ruined a greater man.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Then you do not agree to a maxim I have sometimes thought
might be laid down, that no one is idle who can do any thing.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—No, certainly.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I conceive it may be illustrated from Wilson, who was
charged with idleness, and who, after painting a little, used to say,
as soon as any friend dropped in, ‘Now let us go somewhere,’—meaning
to the alehouse. All that Wilson could do, he did, and
that finely too, with a few well-disposed masses and strokes of the
pencil; but he could not finish, or he would have staid within all
the morning to work up his pictures to the perfection of Claude’s.
He thought it better to go to the alehouse than to spoil what he had
already done. I have in my own mind made this excuse for —,
that he could only make a first sketch, and was obliged to lose the
greatest part of his time in waiting for <em>windfalls</em> of heads and studies.
I have sat to him twice, and each time I offered to come again, and
he said he would let me know, but I heard no more of it. The
sketch went as it was—of course in a very unfinished state.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—But he might have remedied this by diligence and practice.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I do not know that he could: one might say that there is
the same abruptness and crudity in his character throughout, in his
conversation, his walk, and look—great force and spirit, but neither
softness nor refinement.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>N.—If he had more humility, he might have seen all that in the
works of others, and have strove to imitate it.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—What I mean is, that it was his not having the sense of these
refinements in himself that prevented his perceiving them in others, or
taking pains to supply a defect to which he was blind.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—I do not think that under any circumstances he would have
made a Raphael. But your reasoning goes too much to what Dr.
Johnson ridiculed in poetry—fits of inspiration, and a greater flow of
ideas in the autumn than the spring. Sir Joshua used to work at all
times, whether he was in the humour or not.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—And so would every one else with his motives and ability to
excel. Lawyers without fees are accused of idleness, but this goes
off when the briefs pour in.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Did you see the newspaper accounts of the election of the
new Pope? It appears that nothing could exceed his repugnance to
be chosen. He begged and even wept to be let off. You are to
consider, he is an old man labouring under a mortal disease (which
is one circumstance that led to his elevation)—to be taken from the
situation of Cardinal (in itself a very enviable one) and thrust violently
into a mass of business, of questions and cabals which will distract
him, and where he can get no thanks and may incur every kind of
odium. It is true, he has an opportunity of making the fortunes of
his family; and if he prefers them to himself, it is all very well, but
not else. To persons of a restless and aspiring turn of mind, ambition
and grandeur are very fine things, but to others they are the most
intolerable tax. There is our own King—there is no conceiving the
punishment that those processions and public show-days are to him—and
then as to all the pomp and glitter that we so much admire, it is
to those who are accustomed to it and who see behind the curtain,
like so much cast-off rags and tinsel or Monmouth-street finery. They
hold it in inconceivable scorn, and yet they can hardly do without it,
from the slavery of habit. Then the time of such people is never
their own—they are always performing a part (and generally a forced
and irksome one) in what no way interests or concerns them. The
late King, to whom rank was a real drudgery, used to stand buried in
a pile of papers, so that you could not see those on the other side of
the table, which he had merely to sign. It is no wonder kings are
sometimes seen to retire to a monastery where religion leaves this
asylum open to them, or are glad to return to their shepherd’s crook
again. No situation can boast of complete ease or freedom; and
even <em>that</em> would have its disadvantages. And then again, look at
those labourers at the top of the house yonder, working from morning
till night, and exposed to all weathers for a bare pittance, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>hope to sweeten their toil, and driven on by hunger and necessity!
When we turn to others, whether those above or below us, we have
little reason to be dissatisfied with our own situation in life. But, in
all cases it is necessary to employ means to ends, be the object what
it may; and where the first have not been taken, it is both unjust and
foolish to repine at the want of success. The common expression,
‘Fortune’s Fools,’ may seem to convey a slur on the order of Providence;
but it rather shows the equality of its distributions. Are the
men of capacity to have all the good things to themselves? They
are proud of their supposed superiority: why are they not contented
with it? If a fool is not to grow rich, the next thing would be, that
none but men of genius should have a coat to their backs, or be
thought fit to live. If it were left to them to provide food or clothes,
they would have none for themselves. It is urged as a striking inequality
that enterprising manufacturers, for instance, should rise to
great wealth and honours, while thousands of their dependants are
labouring hard at one or two shillings a-day: but we are to recollect,
that if it had not been for men like these, the working classes would
have been perishing for want: they collect the others together, give
a direction and find a vent for their industry, and may be said to
exercise a part of <em>sovereign</em> capacity. Every thing has its place and
due subordination. If authors had the direction of the world, nothing
would be left standing but printing-presses.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—What do you think of that portrait?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—It is very lady-like, and, I should imagine, a good likeness.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—J— said I might go on painting yet—he saw no falling-off.
<em>They</em> are pleased with it. I have painted almost the whole family,
and the girls would let their mother sit to nobody else. But Lord!
every thing one can do seems to fall so short of nature: whether it is
the want of skill or the imperfection of the art that cannot give the
successive movements of expression and changes of countenance, I am
always ready to beg pardon of my sitters after I have done, and to
say I hope they’ll excuse it. The more one knows of the art, and
indeed the better one can do, the less one is satisfied. This made
Titian write under his pictures <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">faciebat</span></i>, signifying that they were only
in progress. I remember, Burke came in one day when Sir Joshua
had been painting one of the Lennoxes; he was quite struck with
the beauty of the performance, and said he hoped Sir Joshua would
not touch it again: to which the latter replied, that if he had seen
the original, he would have thought little of the picture, and that there
was a <em>look</em> which it was hardly in the power of art to give. No! all
we can do is to produce something that makes a distant approach to
nature, and that serves as a faint relic of the individual. A portrait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>is only a little better memorial than the parings of the nails or a lock
of the hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Who is it?</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—It is a Lady W—: you have heard me speak of her
before. She is a person of great sense and spirit, and combines very
opposite qualities from a sort of natural strength of character. She
has shown the greatest feeling and firmness united: no one can have
more tenderness in her domestic connexions, and yet she has borne
the loss of some of them with exemplary fortitude. Perhaps, the
one is a consequence of the other; for where the attachment or even
the regret is left, all is not lost. The mind has still a link to connect
it with the beloved object. She has no affectation; and therefore
yields to unavoidable circumstances as they arise. Inconsolable grief
is often mere cant, and a trick to impose on ourselves and others.
People of any real strength of character are seldom affected: those
who have not the clue of their own feelings to guide them, do not
know what to do, and study only how to produce an effect. I
recollect one of the Miss B—s, Lord Orford’s favourites, whom I
met with at a party formerly, using the expression—‘That seal of
mediocrity, affectation!’ Don’t you think this striking?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Yes; but not quite free from the vice it describes.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Oh! they had plenty of that: they were regular <em>blue-stockings</em>,
I assure you; or they would not have been so entirely to his lordship’s
taste, who was a mighty coxcomb. But there is none of that
in the person I have been speaking of: she has very delightful, genteel,
easy manners.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—That is the only thing I envy in people in that class.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—But you are not to suppose they all have it: it is only those
who are born with it, and who would have had it in a less degree in
every situation of life. Vulgarity is the growth of courts as well as
of the hovel. We may be deceived by a certain artificial or conventional
manner in persons of rank and fashion; but they themselves
see plainly enough into the natural character. I remember Lady
W— told me, as an instance to this purpose, that when she was a
girl, she and her sister were introduced at court; and it was then the
fashion to stand in a circle, and the Queen came round and spoke to
the different persons in turn. There was some high lady who came
in after them, and pushed rudely into the circle so as to get before
them. But the Queen, who saw the circumstance, went up and spoke
to them first, and then passed on (as a just punishment) without
taking any notice whatever of the forward intruder. I forget how it
arose the other day, but she asked me—‘Pray, Mr. Northcote, is
Discretion reckoned one of the cardinal virtues?’ ‘No,’ I said, ‘it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>is not one of them, for it is all!’ If we had discretion at all times,
we should never do wrong: but we are taken off our guard by being
thrown into new and difficult situations, and have not time to weigh
the consequences or to summon resolution to our aid. That is what
Opie used to say when he had been engaged in an argument over-night,
what excellent answers he could give the next day—and was
vexed with himself for not having thought of them. No! if we had
sufficient presence of mind to foresee the consequences of our actions
on the spot, we should very rarely have occasion to repent of them
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—You put me in mind of Cicero’s account of the cardinal virtues,
in his <cite>Offices</cite>, who makes them out to be four; and then says they are
all referable to the first, which is <cite>Prudence</cite>.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Ay; do you recollect what they are?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Prudence, Temperance, Justice, and Fortitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—They are too much alike. The most distinct is Fortitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I never could make much of Cicero, except his two treatises
on Friendship and Old Age, which are most amiable gossiping. I
see that Canning borrowed his tautology from Cicero, who runs on
with such expressions as ‘I will <em>bear</em>, I will <em>suffer</em>, I will <em>endure</em> any
extremity.’ This is bad enough in the original: it is inexcusable in
the copy. Cicero’s style, however, answered to the elegance of his
finely-turned features; and in his long, graceful neck you may trace
his winding and involuted periods.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Do you believe in that sort of stuff?</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—Not more than I can help.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>CONVERSATION THE TWENTY-SECOND</h4>

<p class='c009'>N.—I ought to cross myself like the Catholics, when I see you.
You terrify me by repeating what I say. But I see you have regulated
yourself. There is nothing personally offensive, except what relates
to Sir Walter. You make him swear too, which he did not do.
He would never use the expression <em>Egad</em>. These little things mark
the gentleman. I am afraid, if he sees it, he’ll say I am a babbler.
That is what they dread so at court, that the least word should
transpire.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—They may have their reasons for caution. At least, they
can gain nothing, and might possibly lose equally by truth or falsehood,
as it must be difficult to convey an adequate idea of royalty.
But authors are glad to be talked about. If Sir W. Scott has an
objection to having his name mentioned, he is singularly unlucky.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>Enough was said in his praise; and I do not believe he is captious.
I fancy he <em>takes the rough with the smooth</em>. I did not well know
what to do. You seemed to express a wish that the conversations
should proceed, and yet you are startled at particular phrases, or
I would have brought you what I had done to show you. I thought
it best to take my chance of the general impression.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—Why, if kept to be published as a diary after my death,
they might do: nobody could then come to ask me questions about
them. But I cannot say they appear very striking to me. One
reason may be, what I observe myself cannot be very new to me.
If others are pleased, they are the best judges. It seems very odd
that you who are acquainted with some of the greatest authors of
the day cannot find any thing of theirs worth setting down.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—That by no means pleases them. I understand G— is
angry at the liberty I take with you. He is quite safe in this
respect. I might answer him much in the manner of the fellow
in the <cite>Country Girl</cite> when his friend introduces his mistress and he
salutes her—‘Why, I suppose if I were to introduce my grandmother
to you’—‘Sir,’ replies the other, ‘I should treat her with
the utmost respect.’ So I shall never think of repeating any of
G—’s conversations. My indifference may arise in part, as you
say, from their not being very new to me. G— might, I dare
say, argue very well on the doctrine of philosophical necessity or
many other questions; but then I have read all this before in Hume
or other writers, and I am very little edified, because I have myself
had access to the same sources that he has drawn from. But you,
as an artist, have been pushed into an intercourse with the world
as well as an observation of nature; and combine a sufficient
knowledge of general subjects with living illustrations of them. I
do not like the conversation of mere men of the world or anecdote-mongers,
for there is nothing to bind it together, and the other sort
is pedantic and tiresome from repetition, so that there is nobody but
you I can come to.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—You do not go enough into society, or you would be cured
of what I cannot help regarding as a whim. You would there find
many people of sense and information whose names you never heard
of. It is not those who have made most noise in the world who
are persons of the greatest general capacity. It is the making the
most of a little, or the being determined to get before others in some
one thing (perhaps for want of other recommendations) that brings
men into notice. Individuals gain a reputation as they make a
fortune, by application and by having set their minds upon it. But
you have set out (like other people brought up among books) with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>such exclusive notions of authors and literary fame, that if you find
the least glimmering of common sense out of this pale, you think
it a prodigy, and run into the opposite extreme. I do not say that
you have not a perception of character, or have not thought as far
as you have observed; but you have not had the opportunities. You
turn your back on the world, and fancy that they turn their backs
on you. This is a very dangerous principle. You become reckless
of consequences. It leads to an abandonment of character. By
setting the opinion of others at defiance, you lose your self-respect.
It is of no use that you still say, you will do what is right; your
passions usurp the place of reason, and whisper you, that whatever
you are bent upon doing is right. You cannot put this deception
on the public, however false or prejudiced their standard may be;
and the opinion of the world, therefore, acts as a seasonable check
upon wilfulness and eccentricity.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—What you have stated is the best excuse I could make for
my own faults or blunders. When one is found fault with for
nothing, or for doing one’s best, one is apt to give the world their
revenge. All the former part of my life I was treated as a cipher;
and since I have got into notice, I have been set upon as a wild
beast. When this is the case, and you can expect as little justice
as candour, you naturally in self-defence take refuge in a sort of
misanthropy and cynical contempt for mankind. One is disposed
to humour them, and to furnish them with some ground for their
idle and malevolent censures.</p>

<p class='c013'>N.—But you should not. If you do nothing to confirm them
in their first prejudices, they will come round in time. They are
slow to admit claims, because they are not <em>sure</em> of their validity;
and they thwart and cross-examine you to try what temper you are
made of. Without some such ordeal or difficulty thrown in the
way, every upstart and pretender must be swallowed whole. That
would never do. But if you have patience to stand the test, justice
is rendered at last, and you are stamped for as much as you are
worth. You certainly have not spared others: why should you
expect nothing but ‘the milk of human kindness?’ Look to those
men behind you (<em>a collection of portraits on the same frame</em>)—there
is Pope and Dryden—did they fare better than living authors?
Had not Dryden his Shadwell, and Pope his Dennis, who fretted
him to a shadow, and galled him almost to death? There was
Dr. Johnson, who in his writings was a pattern of wisdom and
morality—he declared that he had been hunted down as if he had
been the great enemy of mankind. But he had strength of mind to
look down upon it. Not to do this, is either infirmity of temper,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>or shows a conscious want of any claims that are worth carrying up
to a higher tribunal than the cabal and clamour of the moment.
Sir Joshua always despised malicious reports; he knew they would
blow over: at the same time, he as little regarded exaggerated praise.
Nothing you could say had any effect, if he was not satisfied with
himself. He had a great game to play, and only looked to the
result. He had studied himself thoroughly; and, besides, had
great equanimity of temper, which, to be sure, it is difficult to
acquire, if it is not natural. You have two faults: one is a <em>feud</em>
or quarrel with the world, which makes you despair, and prevents
you taking all the pains you might: the other is a carelessness and
mismanagement, which makes you throw away the little you actually
do, and brings you into difficulties that way. Sir Joshua used to
say it was as wrong for a man to think too little as too much of
himself: if the one ran him into extravagance and presumption, the
other sank him in sloth and insignificance. You see the same thing
in horses: if they cannot stir a load at the first effort, they give it
up as a hopeless task; and nothing can rouse them from their
sluggish obstinacy but blows and ill-treatment.</p>

<p class='c013'>H.—I confess all this, but I hardly know how to remedy it; nor
do I feel any strong inducement. Taking one thing with another,
I have no great cause to complain. If I had been a merchant, a
bookseller, or the proprietor of a newspaper, instead of what I am,
I might have had more money or possessed a town and countryhouse,
instead of lodging in a first or second floor, as it may happen.
But what then? I see how the man of business and fortune passes
his time. He is up and in the city by eight, swallows his breakfast
in haste, attends a meeting of creditors, must read Lloyd’s lists,
consult the price of consols, study the markets, look into his
accounts, pay his workmen, and superintend his clerks: he has
hardly a minute in the day to himself, and perhaps in the four-and-twenty
hours does not do a single thing that he would do if he
could help it. Surely, this sacrifice of time and inclination requires
some compensation, which it meets with. But how am I entitled
to make my fortune (which cannot be done without all this anxiety
and drudgery) who do hardly any thing at all, and never any thing
but what I like to do? I rise when I please, breakfast <em>at length</em>,
write what comes into my head, and after taking a mutton-chop and
a dish of strong tea, go to the play, and thus my time passes.
Mr. — has no time to go to the play. It was but the other day
that I had to get up a little earlier than usual to go into the city
about some money transaction, which appeared to me a prodigious
hardship: if so, it was plain that I must lead a tolerably easy life:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>nor should I object to passing mine over again. Till I was twenty,
I had no idea of any thing but books, and thought every thing else
was worthless and mechanical. The having to study painting about
this time, and finding the difficulties and beauties it unfolded, opened
a new field to me, and I began to conclude that there might be a
number of ‘other things between heaven and earth that were never
dreamt of in my philosophy.’ Ask G—, or any other literary
man who has never been taken out of the leading-strings of learning,
and you will perceive that they hold for a settled truth that the
universe is built of words. G— has no interest but in literary
fame, of which he is a worshipper: he cannot believe that any one
is clever, or has even common sense, who has not written a book.
If you talk to him of Italian cities, where great poets and patriots
lived, he heaves a sigh; and if I were possessed of a fortune, he
should go and visit the house where Galileo lived or the tower
where Ugolino was imprisoned. He can see with the eyes of his
mind. To all else he is marble. It is like speaking to him of the
objects of a <em>sixth sense</em>; every other language seems dumb and
inarticulate.</p>

    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘The work here offered to the public is a selection from the four volumes of <cite>Table 
    Talk</cite>, printed in London. Should it meet with success, it will be followed by two 
    other volumes of the same description, which will include all that the author wishes to 
    preserve of his writings in this kind. The title may perhaps serve to explain what there 
    is of peculiarity in the style or mode of treating the subjects. I had remarked that when 
    I had written or thought upon a<a id='t469'></a> particular topic, and afterwards had 
    occasion to speak of it with a friend, the conversation generally took a much wider 
    range, and branched off into a number of indirect and collateral questions, which were 
    not strictly connected with the original view of the subject, but which often threw a 
    curious and striking light upon it, or upon human life in general. It therefore occurred 
    to me as possible to combine the advantages of these two styles, the <em>literary</em> 
    and the <em>conversational</em>; or after stating and enforcing some leading idea, to 
    follow it up by such observations and reflections as would probably suggest themselves in 
    discussing the same question in company with others. This seemed to me to promise a 
    greater variety and richness, and perhaps a greater sincerity, than could be attained by 
    a more precise and scholastic method. The same consideration had an influence on the 
    familiarity and conversational idiom of the style which I have used. How far the plan was 
    feasible, or how far I have succeeded in the execution of it must be left to others to 
    decide. I am also afraid of having too frequently attempted to give a popular air and 
    effect to subtle distinctions and trains of thought; so that I shall be considered as too 
    metaphysical by the careless reader, while by the more severe and scrupulous inquirer my 
    style will be complained of as too light and desultory. To all this I can only answer 
    that I have done not what I wished, but the best I could do; and I heartily wish it had 
    been better.’

    almost exclusively with Leigh Hunt, but the expression became <span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>popular, and was 
    afterwards applied, not only by <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite>, but by <cite>The 
    Quarterly Review</cite>, to Keats, Lamb, Shelley, and Hazlitt among others. See Lang’s 
    <cite>Life of Lockhart</cite>, <span class='fss'>I.</span> 146 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i>, and 
    Mrs. Oliphant’s <cite>William Blackwood and his Sons</cite>, <span class='fss'>I.</span> 
    132 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i> and 164–7, where a letter from Lockhart and Wilson to John 
    Murray is printed, in which the writers refer to ‘that happy name which you and all the 
    reviews are now borrowing.’ The attacks on Keats referred to by Hazlitt appeared in 
    <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite> for Aug. 1818 (the 4th of the ‘Cockney School’ Series), 
    and in <cite>The Quarterly Review</cite> for April 1818, published in September. It is 
    not known who wrote the <cite>Blackwood</cite> article; the review in the 
    <cite>Quarterly</cite> was by Croker. Much has been written as to the effect of these 
    attacks on Keats’s health and happiness, but it is obviously impossible to come to any 
    definite conclusion. Keats died in Rome on the 23rd Feb. 1821.

<h3 class='c008'>MR. NORTHCOTE’S CONVERSATIONS</h3>

 <dl class='dl_1 c004'>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>James Northcote (1746–1831), was the son of Samuel Northcote, a Plymouth watchmaker. He 
    was brought to the notice of Sir Joshua Reynolds by the Mudges of Plymouth (see note to 
    p. 366). Sir Joshua befriended him and he sat as one of the figures in Ugolino. After 
    study in London and abroad he began to acquire reputation as a portrait-painter. He 
    exhibited at the Royal Academy first in 1781, and of that body he was elected an 
    Associate in 1786, and an Academician on Feb. 13, 1787. He painted many historical and 
    sacred subjects, but his reputation will rest upon his portraits, many of which may be 
    seen in the National Portrait Gallery. He wrote the <cite>Memoirs of Sir Joshua 
    Reynolds</cite> (1813–15) wherein several of the anecdotes which occur in the 
    conversations first appear, and was helped in two other pieces of literary work by 
    Hazlitt, viz., <cite>The Life of Titian, with Anecdotes of the Distinguished Persons of 
    his Time</cite> (1830), and <cite>One Hundred Fables, Original and Selected</cite> 
    (1828), the wood-cuts to which, by William Harvey, from Northcote’s designs, are of value 
    with respect to the art of English wood-engraving. A Second Series was issued in 1833, 
    after his death. He spoke Devonshire all his life and never married. See <cite>Memorials 
    of an Eighteenth Century Painter</cite> (James Northcote): by Stephen Gwynn, 1898; 
    <cite>Conversations of James Northcote, R.A., with James Ward on Art and Artists</cite>: 
    edited by Ernest Fletcher, 1901; P. G. Patmore’s <cite>My Friends and 
    Acquaintances</cite>; Hazlitt’s essay ‘On the Old Age of Artists’ in <cite>The Plain 
    Speaker</cite>; Ruskin’s <cite>Præterita</cite>; and <cite>The Examiner</cite>, May 4th, 
    1833.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>The circumstances under which the ‘Conversations’ were reported and printed will be found 
    set forth in the ‘Memoirs of William Hazlitt,’ vol. <span class='fss'>II.</span> pp. 
    198–213. After six issues had appeared in <cite>The New Monthly Magazine</cite> a Mr. 
    Rosdew protested on behalf of the Mudges against some remarks that appeared therein. The 
    passages, which are given below in the Notes for the first time since they appeared in 
    the <cite>Magazine</cite> (they <span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>were omitted when Hazlitt collected the papers 
    for a volume), may explain this protest. The publication of further issues seems to have 
    been stopped by the Editor, Thomas Campbell. Four Conversations (see note to p. 394), 
    were contributed to <cite>Richardson’s London Weekly Review</cite>, and their existence 
    there does not seem to have been noted until the present edition. Their publication was 
    transferred to <cite>The Atlas</cite> (see note to p. 420), and finished therein. 
    Unfortunately, the British Museum file of <cite>The Atlas</cite> is defective, and it has 
    not so far been possible to check every ‘Conversation’ with its first appearance in 
    magazine form. Where possible, however, this has been done, and a few passages are given 
    below which were not reprinted by Hazlitt.

    <dd>‘I differ from my great original and predecessor (James Boswell, Esq., of Auchinleck), in 
    this, that whereas he is supposed to have invented nothing, I have feigned whatever I 
    pleased. I have forgotten, mistaken, mis-stated, altered, transposed a number of things. 
    All that can be relied upon for certain is a striking anecdote or a sterling remark or 
    two in each page. These belong as a matter of right to my principal speaker: the rest I 
    have made for him by interpolating or paraphrasing what he said. My object was to catch 
    the tone and manner, rather than to repeat the exact expressions, or even opinions; just 
    as it is possible to recognise the voice of an acquaintance without distinguishing the 
    particular words he uses. Sometimes I have allowed an acute or a severe remark to stand 
    without the accompanying softenings or explanations, for the sake of effect; and at other 
    times added whole passages without any foundation, to fill up space. For instance, there 
    is a dissertation on pp. 75–6, the particulars and the Tory turn of which are entirely my 
    own. My friend Mr. N— is a determined Whig. I have, however, generally taken him as my 
    lay-figure or model, and worked upon it, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">selon mon gré</span></i>, by fancying how he 
    would express himself on any occasion, and making up a conversation according to this 
    preconception in my mind. I have also introduced little incidental details that never 
    happened; thus, by lying, giving a greater air of truth to the scene—an art understood by 
    most historians! In a word, Mr. N— is only answerable for the wit, sense, and spirit, 
    there may be in these papers: I take all the dullness, impertinence, and malice upon 
    myself. He has furnished the text—I fear I have often spoiled it by the commentary. Or 
    (to give it a more favourable turn) I have expanded him into a book, as another friend<a 
    id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a> has 
    continued the history of the Honeycombs <span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>down to the present period. My 
    Dialogues are done much upon the same principle as the <cite>Family Journal</cite>: I 
    shall be more than satisfied if they are thought to possess but half the spirit and 
    verisimilitude,’

    married, and who continued a violent Dissenter to the last) used to say—“There he gets up 
    into the pulpit, and prates away as if he knew all the secrets of heaven and earth, and 
    all the time does not believe one word of it.” My father who knew him, said there was 
    always to him a look of insincerity in his very high-flown orthodoxy, for once when 
    Smeaton, the great engineer, was making a remark on some circumstance in the Old 
    Testament, he cut him short by saying, “Oh! if you give up any part, the whole must 
    follow!” He used also to say, in speaking of the arguments on natural religion, that in 
    an infinity of chances everything was possible. If he had been at Rome, he would have got 
    to be a Cardinal as sure as I am standing here. He had ambition and abilities enough for 
    any thing. Yet it was like pride in a corner too. His wife would always put a brick 
    behind the fire to keep it low, and would come in and boil the saucepan by his 
    study-fire, just as when they had been in poverty and mean circumstances, and yet he 
    never objected. He grew indolent at last, and spent his time in playing at cards with old 
    ladies who were rich and pious. He hated writing sermons (though it was what he was 
    chiefly admired for), and preached the same set over and over again, till the 
    congregation nearly had them by heart. I said it was what he did not feel, and he 
    therefore set about it reluctantly.’

    they brought him the wrong number. “Why am I to wear No. 16, when I have not had No. 15? 
    Why am I to do nothing that I like? Am I king of England, or am I not? That is what I 
    want to know.” And then he would fall to kicking his hat about the room to vent his 
    anger, and rating any of the ministers that came in in his outlandish jargon. Once he was 
    going to kick the Duke of <span class='sc'>Argyll</span>, who laid his hand upon his 
    sword, and withdrew in high dudgeon. Meeting Sir <span class='sc'>Robert Walpole</span> 
    on the staircase, he complained of what had happened, to which the other replied, “Oh!

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. There is a passage in Werter which contains a very pleasing illustration of this
doctrine, and is as follows.</p>

<p class='c013'>‘About a league from the town is a place called Walheim. It is very agreeably
situated on the side of a hill: from one of the paths which leads out of the village,
you have a view of the whole country; and there is a good old woman who sells
wine, coffee, and tea there: but better than all this are two lime-trees before the
church, which spread their branches over a little green, surrounded by barns and
cottages. I have seen few places more retired and peaceful. I send for a chair
and table from the old woman’s, and there I drink my coffee and read Homer.
It was by accident that I discovered this place one fine afternoon: all was perfect
stillness; every body was in the fields, except a little boy about four years old, who
was sitting on the ground, and holding between his knees a child of about six
months; he pressed it to his bosom with his little arms, which made a sort of
great chair for it, and notwithstanding the vivacity which sparkled in his eyes, he
sat perfectly still. Quite delighted with the scene, I sat down on a plough
opposite, and had great pleasure in drawing this little picture of brotherly tenderness.
I added a bit of the hedge, the barn-door, and some broken cart-wheels,
without any order, just as they happened to lie; and in about an hour I found I
had made a drawing of great expression and very correct design, without having
put in any thing of my own. This confirmed me in the resolution I had made
before, only to copy nature for the future. Nature is inexhaustible, and alone
forms the greatest masters. Say what you will of rules, they alter the true
features, and the natural expression.’ Page 15.</p>

of their opinions, and are therefore accustomed to ascertain pretty accurately the
grounds on which they act, before they commit themselves on the event, are often
men of remarkably quick and sound judgments. Artists in like manner must
know tolerably well what they are about, before they can bring the result of their
observations to the test of ocular demonstration.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. If we take away from <em>the present</em> the moment that is just gone by and the
moment that is next to come, how much of it will be left for this plain, practical
theory to rest upon? Their solid basis of sense and reality will reduce itself to a
pin’s point, a hair-line, on which our moral balance-masters will have some
difficulty to maintain their footing without falling over on either side.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. A treatise on the Millennium is dull; but who was ever weary of reading the
fables of the Golden Age? On my once observing I should like to have been
Claude, a person said, ‘they should not, for that then by this time it would have
been all over with them.’ As if it could possibly signify when we live (save and
excepting the present minute), or as if the value of human life decreased or
increased with successive centuries. At that rate, we had better have our life
still to come at some future period, and so postpone our existence century after
century <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. In like manner, though we know that an event must have taken place at a
distance, long before we can hear the result, yet as long as we remain in ignorance
of it, we irritate ourselves about it, and suffer all the agonies of suspense, as if it
was still to come; but as soon as our uncertainty is removed, our fretful impatience
vanishes, we resign ourselves to fate, and make up our minds to what has happened
as well as we can.</p>

well-known sound is heard, does not merely recal to them the idea of their
country, but has associated with it a thousand nameless ideas, numberless touches
of private affection, of early hope, romantic adventure, and national pride, all
which rush in (with mingled currents) to swell the tide of fond remembrance, and
make them languish or die for home. What a fine instrument the human heart
is! Who shall touch it? Who shall fathom it? Who shall ‘sound it from its
lowest note to the top of its compass?’ Who shall put his hand among the
strings, and explain their wayward music? The heart alone, when touched by
sympathy, trembles and responds to their hidden meaning!</p>

memory was the following. A gentleman was mentioning his having been sent
up to London from the place where he lived to see Garrick act. When he went
back into the country, he was asked what he thought of the player and the play.
‘Oh!’ he said, ‘he did not know: he had only seen a little man strut about the
stage, and repeat 7956 words.’ We all laughed at this, but a person in one corner
of the room, holding one hand to his forehead, and seeming mightily delighted,
called out, ‘Ay, indeed! And pray, was he found to be correct?’ This was the
supererogation of literal matter-of-fact curiosity. Jedediah Buxton’s counting the
number of words was idle enough; but here was a fellow who wanted some one to
count them over again to see if he was correct.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. Mr. Cobbett speaks almost as well as he writes. The only time I ever
saw him he seemed to me a very pleasant man—easy of access, affable, clearheaded,
simple and mild in his manner, deliberate and unruffled in his speech,
though some of his expressions were not very qualified. His figure is tall and
portly. He has a good sensible face—rather full, with little grey eyes, a hard,
square forehead, a ruddy complexion, with hair grey or powdered; and had on a
scarlet broad-cloth waistcoat with the flaps of the pockets hanging down, as was
the custom for gentlemen-farmers in the last century, or as we see it in the
pictures of Members of Parliament in the reign of George <span class='fss'>I.</span> I certainly did not

<p class='c013'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. These fantastic poets are like a foolish ringer at Plymouth that Northcote
tells the story of. He was proud of his ringing, and the boys who made a jest
of his foible used to get him in the belfry, and ask him, ‘Well now, John, how
many good ringers are there in Plymouth?’ ‘Two,’ he would say, without any
hesitation. ‘Ay, indeed! and who are they?’—‘Why, first, there’s myself,
that’s one: and—and’—‘Well, and who’s the other?’—‘Why there’s,
there’s—Ecod, I can’t think of any other but myself.’ <em>Talk we of one Master
Launcelot.</em> The story is of ringers: it will do for any vain, shallow, self-satisfied
egotist of them all.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. The celebrated Peter Pindar (Dr. Wolcot) first discovered and brought out
the talents of the late Mr. Opie, the painter. He was a poor Cornish boy, and
was out at work in the fields, when the poet went in search of him. ‘Well,
my lad, can you go and bring me your very best picture?’ The other flew like
lightning, and soon came back with what he considered as his masterpiece. The
stranger looked at it, and the young artist, after waiting for some time without
his giving any opinion, at length exclaimed eagerly, ‘Well, what do you think of
it?’—‘Think of it?’ said Wolcot, ‘why I think you ought to be ashamed of it—that
you who might do so well, do no better!’ The same answer would have
applied to this artist’s latest performances, that had been suggested by one of his
earliest efforts.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. A thorough fitness for any end implies the means. Where there is a will,
there is a way. A real passion, an entire devotion to any object, always succeeds.
The strong sympathy with what we wish and imagine, realises it, dissipates all
obstacles, and removes all scruples. The disappointed lover may complain as
much as he pleases. He was himself to blame. He was a half witted, <em>wishy-washy</em>
fellow. His love might be as great as he makes it out: but it was not his
ruling-passion. His fear, his pride, his vanity was greater. Let any one’s whole
soul be steeped in this passion, let him think and care for nothing else, let nothing
divert, cool, or intimidate him, let the <em>ideal</em> feeling become an actual one and take
possession of his whole faculties, looks, and manner, let the same voluptuous hopes
and wishes govern his actions in the presence of his mistress that haunt his fancy
in her absence, and I will answer for his success. But I will not answer for the
success of a ‘dish of skimmed milk’ in such a case. I could always get to see a
fine collection of pictures myself. The fact is, I was set upon it. Neither the
surliness of porters, nor the impertinence of footmen could keep me back. I had
a portrait of Titian in my eye, and nothing could put me out in my determination.
If that had not (as it were) been looking on me all the time I was battling my
way, I should have been irritated or disconcerted, and gone away. But my liking
to the end conquered my scruples or aversion to the means. I never understood
the Scotch character but on these occasions. I would not take ‘No’ for an answer.
If I had wanted a place under government, or a writership to India, I could have
got it from the same importunity, and on the same terms.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r33'>33</a>. A poor woman at Plymouth who did not like the formality, or could not
afford the expence, of a will, thought to leave what little property she had in
wearing-apparel and household moveables to her friends and relations, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivá voce</span></i>,
and before Death stopped her breath. She gave and willed away (of her proper
authority) her chair and table to one, her bed to another, an old cloak to a third,
a night-cap and petticoat to a fourth, and so on. The old crones sat weeping
round, and soon after carried off all they could lay their hands upon, and left
their benefactress to her fate. They were no sooner gone than she unexpectedly
recovered, and sent to have her things back again; but not one of them could she
get, and she was left without a rag to her back, or a friend to condole with her.</p>

the other hand, mathematicians, abstract reasoners, of no manner of attachment
to persons, at least to the visible part of them, but prodigiously devoted to the
ideas of virtue, liberty, and so forth, are generally <em>whigs</em>. It happens agreeably

<p class='c013'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. To give the modern reader <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un petit aperçu</span></i> of the tone of literary conversation
about five or six and twenty years ago, I remember being present in a large party
composed of men, women, and children, in which two persons of remarkable candour
and ingenuity were labouring (as hard as if they had been paid for it) to prove
that all prayer was a mode of dictating to the Almighty, and an arrogant assumption
of superiority. A gentleman present said, with great simplicity and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>, that
there was one prayer which did not strike him as coming exactly under this description,
and being asked what that was, made answer, ‘The Samaritan’s—“Lord, be
merciful to me a sinner!”’ This appeal by no means settled the sceptical dogmatism
of the two disputants, and soon after the proposer of the objection went away;
on which one of them observed with great marks of satisfaction and triumph.—‘I
am afraid we have shocked that gentleman’s prejudices.’ This did not appear to
me at that time quite the thing, and this happened in the year 1794. Twice has
the iron entered my soul. Twice have the dastard, vaunting, venal crew gone
over it; once as they went forth, conquering and to conquer, with reason by their
side, glittering like a faulchion, trampling on prejudices and marching fearlessly
on in the work of regeneration; once again, when they returned with retrograde
steps, like Cacus’s oxen dragged backward by the heels, to the den of Legitimacy,
‘rout on rout, confusion worse confounded,’ with places and pensions and the
Quarterly Review dangling from their pockets, and shouting ‘Deliverance for
mankind,’ for ‘the worst, the second fall of man.’ Yet I have endured all this
marching and countermarching of poets, philosophers, and politicians over my head
as well as I could, like ‘the camomoil that thrives, the more ’tis trod upon.’ By
Heavens, I think, I’ll endure it no longer!</p>

regularity; if when thus attired he issues forth, and meets a Cherokee Indian,
who has bestowed as much time at his toilet, and laid on with equal care and

<p class='c013'>This dotage on sound and show seemed characteristic of that age (see <cite>New Way

intellectual and abstract topics of thought and discourse (the thin, circulating
medium of the present day) the mind was attracted without the power of resistance
to the tinkling sound of its own name with a title added to it, and the
image of its own person tricked out in old-fashioned finery. The effect, no
doubt, was also more marked and striking from the contrast between the ordinary

<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r53'>53</a>. Every thing tends to show the manner in which a great artist is formed. If
any person could claim an exemption from the careful imitation of individual
objects, it was Nicolas Poussin. He studied the antique, but he also studied
nature. ‘I have often admired,’ says Vignuel de Marville, who knew him at a
late period of his life, ‘the love he had for his art. Old as he was, I frequently
saw him among the ruins of ancient Rome, out in the Campagna, or along the
banks of the Tyber, sketching a scene that had pleased him; and I often met him
with his handkerchief full of stones, moss, or flowers, which he carried home, that
he might copy them exactly from nature. One day I asked him how he had
attained to such a degree of perfection, as to have gained so high a rank among the
great painters of Italy? He answered, <span class='sc'>I have neglected nothing.</span>’—<em>See his Life
lately published.</em> It appears from this account that he had not fallen into a recent
error, that Nature puts the man of genius out. As a contrast to the foregoing
description, I might mention, that I remember an old gentleman once asking Mr.
West in the British Gallery, if he had ever been at Athens? To which the
President made answer, No; nor did he feel any great desire to go; for that he
thought he had as good an idea of the place from the Catalogue, as he could get by
living there for any number of years. What would he have said, if any one had
told him, he could get as good an idea of the subject of one of his great works
from reading the Catalogue of it, as from seeing the picture itself! Yet the answer
was characteristic of the genius of the painter.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f54'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. Poussin has repeated this subject more than once, and appears to have revelled
in its witcheries. I have before alluded to it, and may again. It is hard that we
should not be allowed to dwell as often as we please on what delights us, when
things that are disagreeable recur so often against our will.</p>

currant-leaves, calling it Radical tobacco, lighting it with a lens in the rays of the
sun, and at every puff fancying that they undermined the Boroughmongers, as
Trim blew up the army opposed to the Allies! They had <em>deceived the Senate</em>.
Methinks I see them now, smiling as in scorn of Corruption.</p>

prominent and wild like a hare’s, fugacious of followers, of the arts by which he
had left the City to lure the patients that he wanted after him to the West-End,
of the ounce of tea that he purchased by stratagem as an unusual treat to his
guest, and of the narrow winding staircase, from the height of which he contemplated
in security the imaginary approach of duns. He was a large, plain,
fair-faced Moravian preacher, turned physician. He was an honest man, but
vain of he knew not what. He was once sitting where Sarratt was playing a
game at chess without seeing the board; and after remaining for some time
absorbed in silent wonder, he turned suddenly to me and said, ‘Do you know,
Mr. H—, that I think there is something I could do?’ ‘Well, what is that?’
‘Why perhaps you would not guess, but I think I could dance, I’m sure I could;
ay, I could dance like Vestris!’—Sarratt, who was a man of various accomplishments,
(among others one of the Fancy,) afterwards bared his arm to convince us
of his muscular strength, and Mrs. L— going out of the room with another
lady said, ‘Do you know, Madam, the Doctor is a great jumper!’ Moliere could
not outdo this. Never shall I forget his pulling off his coat to eat beef-steaks on
equal terms with Martin B—. Life is short, but full of mirth and pastime,
did we not so soon forget what we have laughed at, perhaps that we may not
remember what we have cried at!—Sarratt, the chess-player, was an extraordinary
man. He had the same tenacious, epileptic faculty in other things that he had at
chess, and could no more get any other ideas out of his mind than he could those
of the figures on the board. He was a great reader, but had not the least taste.
Indeed the violence of his memory tyrannised over and destroyed all power of
selection. He could repeat Ossian by heart, without knowing the best passage
from the worst; and did not perceive he was tiring you to death by giving an
account of the breed, education, and manners of fighting-dogs for hours together.
The sense of reality quite superseded the distinction between the pleasurable and
the painful. He was altogether a mechanical philosopher.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f59'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r59'>59</a>. When I was young, I spent a good deal of my time at Manchester and
Liverpool; and I confess I give the preference to the former. There you were
oppressed only by the aristocracy of wealth; in the latter by the aristocracy of
wealth and letters by turns. You could not help feeling that some of their great
men were authors among merchants and merchants among authors. Their bread
was buttered on both sides, and they had you at a disadvantage either way. The
Manchester cotton-spinners, on the contrary, set up no pretensions beyond their
looms, were hearty good fellows, and took any information or display of ingenuity
on other subjects in good part. I remember well being introduced to a distinguished
patron of art and rising merit at a little distance from Liverpool, and
was received with every mark of attention and politeness, till the conversation
turning on Italian literature, our host remarked that there was nothing in the
English language corresponding to the severity of the Italian ode—except perhaps
Dryden’s Alexander’s Feast, and Pope’s St. Cecilia! I could no longer contain my
desire to display my smattering in criticism, and began to maintain that Pope’s Ode
was, as it appeared to me, far from an example of severity in writing. I soon perceived
what I had done, but here am I writing <cite>Table-talks</cite> in consequence. Alas!
I knew as little of the world then as I do now. I never could understand any
thing beyond an abstract definition.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. Lord H— had made a diary (in the manner of Boswell) of the conversation
held at his house, and read it at the end of a week <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro bono publico</span></i>. Sir J—
M— made a considerable figure in it, and a celebrated poet none at all, merely
answering Yes and No. With this result he was by no means satisfied, and talked
incessantly from that day forward. At the end of the week he asked, with some
anxiety and triumph, if his Lordship had continued his diary, expecting himself to
shine in ‘the first row of the rubric.’ To which his Noble Patron answered in the
negative, with an intimation that it had not appeared to him worth while. Our
poet was thus thrown again into the back ground, and Sir James remained master
of the field!</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r61'>61</a>. A Mr. Rose and the Rev. Dr. Kippis were for many years its principal
support. Mrs. Rose (I have heard my father say) contributed the Monthly
Catalogue. There is sometimes a certain tartness and the woman’s tongue in it.
It is said of Gray’s Elegy—‘This little poem, however humble its pretensions, is
not without elegance or merit.’ The characters of prophet and critic are not
always united.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f62'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r62'>62</a>. There are some splendid exceptions to this censure. His comparison between
Ovid and Virgil, and his character of Shakespear, are masterpieces of their kind.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f63'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r63'>63</a>. We have critics in the present day who cannot tell what to make of the
tragic writers of Queen Elizabeth’s age (except Shakespear, who passes by
prescriptive right,) and are extremely puzzled to reduce the efforts of their ‘great
and irregular’ power to the standard of their own slight and shewy common-places.
The truth is, they had better give up the attempt to reconcile such
contradictions as an artificial taste and natural genius; and repose on the admiration
of verses which derive their odour from the scent of rose-leaves inserted between
the pages, and their polish from the smoothness of the paper on which they are
printed. They, and such writers as Deckar and Webster, Beaumont and
Fletcher, Ford and Marlowe, move in different orbits of the human intellect, and
need never jostle.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f64'>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r68'>68</a>. Losing gamesters thus become desperate, because the continued and violent

<div class='footnote' id='f69'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r69'>69</a>. Some of the poets in the beginning of the last century would often set out on

<p class='c013'><a href='#r71'>71</a>. I have heard of such a thing as an author, who makes it a rule never to admit

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f73'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r73'>73</a>. We sometimes see a whole play-house in tears. But the audience at a theatre,
though a public assembly, are not a public body. They are not incorporated into
a frame-work of exclusive, narrow-minded interests of their own. Each individual
looks out of his own insignificance at a scene, <em>ideal</em> perhaps, and foreign to himself,
but true to nature; friends, strangers, meet on the common ground of humanity,
and the tears that spring from their breasts are those which ‘sacred pity has
engendered.’ They are a mixed multitude melted into sympathy by remote,
imaginary events, not a combination cemented by petty views, and sordid, selfish
prejudices.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f74'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r74'>74</a>. Mr. Munden and Mr. C— went one Sunday to Windsor, to see the King.
They passed with other spectators once or twice: at last, his late majesty distinguished
Munden in the crowd, and called him to him. After treating him
with much cordial familiarity, the king said, ‘And, pray, who is that with you?’
Munden, with many congées, and contortions of face, replied, ‘An please your
majesty, it’s Mr. C—, of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.’ ‘Oh! yes,’ said
the king, ‘I know him well—a bad actor, a bad actor, a bad actor!’ Why kings
should repeat what they say three times, is odd: their saying it once is quite
enough. I have always liked Mr. C—’s face since I heard this anecdote, and
perhaps the telling it may have the same effect on other people.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r78'>78</a>. I cannot say how in this respect it might have fared if a Mr. M—, a fat
gentleman, who might not have ‘liked yon lean and hungry Roscius,’ had continued in the theatrical department of Mr. Perry’s paper at the time of this actor’s
first appearance; but I had been put upon this duty just before, and afterwards
Mr. M—’s <em>spare</em> talents were not in much request. This, I believe, is the reason
why he takes pains every now and then to inform the readers of the Courier that it
is impossible for any one to understand a word that I write.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f79'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r79'>79</a>. I (not very long ago) had the pleasure of spending an evening with Mr. Betty,
when we had some ‘good talk’ about the good old times of acting. I wanted to
insinuate that I had been a sneaking admirer, but could not bring it in. As, however,
we were putting on our great coats down stairs, I ventured to break the ice
by saying, ‘There is one actor of that period of whom we have not made honourable
mention, I mean Master Betty.’ ‘Oh!’ he said, ‘I have forgot all that.’ I
replied, that he might, but that I could not forget the pleasure I had had in seeing
him. On which he turned off, and shaking his sides heartily, and with no
measured demand upon his lungs, called out, ‘Oh, memory! memory!’ in a way
that showed he felt the full force of the allusion. I found afterwards that the
subject did not offend, and we were to have drunk some Burton-ale together the
following evening, but were prevented. I hope he will consider that the engagement
still stands good.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f80'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r80'>80</a>. Sir Joshua, who was not a vain man, purchased a tawdry sheriff’s carriage,
soon after he took his house in Leicester-fields, and desired his sister to ride about

‘It belongs to the great painter!’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f81'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r81'>81</a>. Sharp became a great favourite of the king on the following occasion. It was
the custom, when the king went through the lobbies of the palace, for those who
preceded him to cry out, ‘Sharp, sharp, look sharp,’ in order to clear the way.
Mr. Sharp, who was waiting in a room just by (preparing some colours), hearing
his name repeated so urgently, ran out in great haste, and came up with all his
force against the king, who was passing the door at the time. The young artist
was knocked down in the encounter, and the attendants were in the greatest consternation;
but the king laughed heartily at the adventure, and took great notice
of the unfortunate subject of it from that time forward.</p>

Aram remarks, ‘Where would you expect to find the bones of a man sooner than

<div class='footnote' id='f87'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r87'>87</a>. It has been usual to raise a very unjust clamour against the enormous salaries
of public singers, actors, and so on. This matter seems reducible to a <em>moral
equation</em>. They are paid out of money raised by voluntary contributions in the
strictest sense; and if they did not bring certain sums into the treasury, the
Managers would not engage them. These sums are exactly in proportion to the
number of individuals to whom their performance gives an extraordinary degree of
pleasure. The talents of a singer, actor, &amp;c. are therefore worth just as much as
they will fetch.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r95'>95</a>. ‘Shakspeare’s verses are not exactly “wood-notes wild.” He was indebted to
a most extensive reading at the same time as to a most transcendant genius. He
did not pique himself upon originality, but sat down to write his plays for the
simple purpose of the moment, and without a glimpse or an ambition of the
immortality which they were to acquire. He made use of whatever he recollected
and thought desirable, with the contrivance of an ordinary play-writer, and only
grew original and vast and exquisite, in spite of himself. If it be true that “he
wrote not for an age, but for all time,” still there was no one who knew less of
that fact than he! He imagined himself writing only for the day before him;
and it is to this very circumstance that we owe the ease, the flashes, and the
soarings of his spirit. He was never over-powered by the intended loftiness of
the occasion. He made no efforts that were laborious, because his mind was
always superior to his object, and never bowed down to it. He possessed, too,
that affluence of genius, which rendered him not only prodigal in its use, but
almost unacquainted with its existence. He never stood upon its dignity; he
was never fearful of its loss nor of its denial. The swan of Avon, like the swans
from which poets derive their title, was all strength and grace and beauty, without
a consciousness of either. And this character of his genius accords with
that character of facility, of gentleness, and of unostentation, which his biographer
ascribes to the man. He knew of nothing within himself, of which he felt it
worth while to be vain. He would as soon have been vain of his power to put
one foot before another, as of his power to write the <cite>Tempest</cite> or <cite>Macbeth</cite>. It
belongs, in the midst of abundance, to <span class='sc'>Genius</span> as <span class='sc'>Beauty</span>, to be thoughtless of
itself. It is only for the dull and the ugly—or at least for those in whom the
claims to beauty or to genius are equivocal—to be forever contemplating either
in themselves, or for ever demanding the acknowledgments of others. With
the plenary possessors, the luxury is too common, too much of every-day wear,
to fix their attention. The restlessness of the remainder is the restlessness of
poverty, and contrasts itself with the carelessness of riches.’—<cite>Kendall’s Letters on
Ireland.</cite></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
